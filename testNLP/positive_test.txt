My grandma's 10 year old Yorkie just would never shut up.  He barked at our cat, at our parrot, and anything that moved really.  We bought this collar, and it worked perfectly and immediately.  One bark and it sprayed, and he would go running off...and stop barking!  I felt kinda bad for him, but his reaction was hilarious.  I couldn't stop laughing at him, poor thing.  However, he did learn that if the collar wasn't on, he wasn't going to get sprayed, so he would bark 
I am looking for a new book light, and as a former owner of this light, I was suprised at the bad bulb stats.  This bulb, like halogen bulbs, get very hot.  It is imperative that you do NOT touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it.  The oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp. and hastens failure.  Hope this help 
I have a 3 1/2 year old Boxer that barks, cries, whines, and howls when I go to work...ALL DAY...I know, I recorded it.  I went to Petsmart and picked up this gadget.  Brought it home and it the manual correct button.  She bolted.  She hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes.  It reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and I don't crate my dog when I'm going to be away for more than 8 hours.  So if I'm just running out for a few hours I stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if I'm going to work I use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar.  My girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it.  Worth the price in my opinion.  Best advice is to take it home and try it.  Some dogs react to it.  Others don't 
I received great customer service and a beautiful plant here. I would recommend this Gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift. My Gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition, is still very healthy, and smells terrific. I've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said "what smells so good grandma? 
I found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate.  It's a soft light (almost seems like a natural spectrum) and is very directed at the page.  The clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover, and the neck is flexible as needed.  So, functionally, it gets a solid A.  But I wasn't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries (two of those round watch/calculator batteries).  Replacing them is a hassle (though inexpensive) because I have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before I leave, and I have to find them in a store with an electronic department.  I wish this light took AAA or something.  The light does include batteries, so you won't need to worry until you run out.  For me, that was  probably around 20 hours or so 
The Bissell Flip-It saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop 
As most people do, I had accumulated several different types of cookware over the years.  It was a real treat to pass these onto my kids and just use this great Cuisinart Chef's Classic set.  I especially love the saute pan 
I picked up a dozen in Home Depot for less than $5. Same concept, just a lot cheaper!  Two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen. The hole they make depends upon the weight of what they're holding. I'm sure it's pinhole sized if you're hanging something that weighs a few ounces (in which case, you don't need this - use a pushpin!)  The holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized, but it IS a heavy shelf. The hole is still WAY smaller than the hole I'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf.  It also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks (the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang.) This is a small detail, but if you need two of these things and you don't do it right, your object is gonna be crooked. But on the bright side, you won't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it!  Recommended product (but look around for the knockoffs. 
After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.  I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.  Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.  I would recommend this with no caveats 
This was my first calaphalon purchase and I am so impressed that I plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future. This pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1/2 qt pans.The unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food. Hand washing the pan is easy. I love this pan !! 
I would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone! It is stylish, sleek,easy to clean, and has plenty of power to handle anything. I feel sorry for michigan, mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink! Awesome! Awesome The first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol' prune who wouldn't be happy with anything! Get it now! 
The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl.  A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together). The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. It's the kind with the rotating hub (two hub sizes are included, one for lemons and a larger one for oranges, etc). While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black & Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying.  The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. At first I was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options, but after thinking about it, you only need the provided On, Off and Pulse.  Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it again from Amazon? Again, absolutely. The transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised 
I have the black Fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room), and my wife and I already love this machine.  We have tried all sorts of mixes, and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do.  This is one of the first times I've been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it.  Physical properties: It handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray, which is largely unneeded anyway), and all our "standard" mugs.  The drink head moves up and down, so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with "frothy" drinks than coffee and tea).  When it brews a filterpack, it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and, thus, keep it from dripping as you remove it).  The water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long), but if you have a ready source of water nearby, it shouldn't be a problem.  The tank fits better and slides on easier than the Senseo (which we also have).  Flavor-wise: It's made by M&M/Mars, so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called Indulgence fare) is excellent.  Coffee blends are quite good, especially the darker roasts like "French Roast" and "Sumatra".  Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks, moreso than other chains.  Clean-up: Wipe the inside of the drink head, and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly "splashy" drinks.  No need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine, especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug.  Of course, you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low, so your first few times, you'll probably get a drip here and there.  Final bits: We've had the Senseo since its launch.  Between pods that need "pre-wetting" to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks, the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia.  We drink coffee, tea, espresso drinks, mixed blends, and sweet-tooth-friendly "indulgence" mixes every day with the Flavia, and it's brain-dead-easy to use.  Certainly easier to clean up after, too!  If you're on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings (like Senseo), get the Flavia.  Keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the Flavia.    I'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now, made over ice, and it's fantastic.  Highly recommended 
For quite a while I had been looking for a certain type of DVD rack/tower...then one day in Target I was looking at the Mission collection and saw the box (no display). It is exactly what I had been looking for. Slapped on the two foot ends and done! Perfect fit for DVDs, 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy DVD cases, like the ones New Line Cinema puts out, you can fit more. I don't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one DVD per slot. I have many oversized ones. The hardwood is great too, just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall. If you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then...it is worth it. I am almost ready to buy a third one soon 
We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners.  They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking.  We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet.  We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews.  I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America.  I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together.  We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack.  I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job.  Ok...our Hoover came.  My husband put it together and it leaked all over.  I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them.  By then we had already taken it to the repair center.  After a week they had not touched it.  My husband picked the machine up  and brought it home.  We decided to start from square one and put it together again.  He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!!  Yeah!  My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman.  So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first 
Okay, I haven't used this while reading in bed yet...but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting, it's great!   The light isn't good for areas that are adequately well-lit, so don't bother to use the light there. But in areas where light is dim, the light shines. Literally. It casts a bright light on the page(s) that you need to view. It's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading.   Yes, it's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag. Imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go.  The power adapter, however, is a cumbersome brick. As for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for, I can't offer an estimate of time yet - but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so- cumulative, not consecutive hours. So, no complaints yet about that.   Whenever I saw this light online or in the store, I used to think, "Why in the world would I ever want something like this?" Now, my thoughts are: "Why didn't I ever think to buy this before? 
Like many people, I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such, they still have no concern for the noise pollution. I was losing sleep, and the barking was getting so bad that I even considered moving!   In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money.  WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...?  It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately. It's as if it's afraid to bark. YAY!  You can select the volume, tone, and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say, from talking or loud bird squawking). Audible and inaudible both work fine, but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting.  The device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 D batteries (not included) to operate it.   I am SO thankful we found Super Bark Stop! My nerves were really getting jangled and I was dreading early mornings, when they put the mutt outside. It's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean I want saddled with its noise while you neglect it!  P.S. After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer. The person I bought it from said that "once it's opened, we find that it's not 100% waterproof". Well guess what? You gotta open it to put the batteries in it! Either buy a faux bird house to protect Bark Stop or house it where it won't get wet. Otherwise, you may find yourself in the same position we were in. We got a refund, and fortunately for us, our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one 
They really do work as advertised.  They go right into drywall (be careful not to hit a stud however!) with no muss and no fuss.  I haven't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds, but for basic home picture hanging, etc. they really do work as advertised 
After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.  I would recommend this with no caveats 
I've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning.  We've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water!  It's a great saucepan and the price was great.  Highly recommended 
I received great customer service and a beautiful plant here. I would recommend this Gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift. My Gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition, is still very healthy, and smells terrific. I've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said "what smells so good grandma? 
My golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old.  Over the years we have tried allergy shots, dietary changes, and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune.  We tried Zymox and it is absolutely fantastic.  Her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment.  The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear.  This stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges, I'm happy to keep it on hand 
I actually purchased this book light so that I can read while I wait for my child to sleep.  he likes me to be in the room.  This was perfect.  Does not put out enough light to bother my son, but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while I wait for him to fall asleep 
This is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone.  I am not in the habit of writing reviews, but this juicer earns it.  Perhaps you are like me, and have never used a juicer before. You want to get one without taking out a small loan, because you just don't know if your that into it. If so, this is your juicer.  There are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting. I just want to back those up with my experience. This is a good, strong product 
This is a significant improvement over the 750 model. The 750 model was not very well designed. The first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. We returned this. We got the 760 to replace that. The 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. For the same price as the 750, the 760 comes with one extra bowl,  juicer and egg whisk. Compared with others like the Cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed. 
I bought one of these for my girlfriend... THEN read the reviews! In my opinion it appears to work fairly well. The sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage. To the far left seems to work best for 'normal' walking. As I said, in terms of accuracy, I think it's pretty good. The radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5' stars. The sound is "tinny"; it's NOT stereo; there's NO frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size! Though overall, when comparing price to features... this little fella will probably suit your needs. If you already have a Walkman (or don't care about audio) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet 
Product arrived promptly,in good condition! This product costs twice as much at Vets office. Somebodies making money!!! 
My 13-year-old cat was limping for a few days, off and on, and my vet said it was probably arthritis. A friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog Nutramax Cosequin had helped him, and I already knew that regular cosequin has helped ME with MY arthritis, so I bought a box of Nutramax Cosequin For Cats from my vet for my kitty to try. It really made a difference! He stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake. He was so happy, and so was I. On my vet's recommendation, I continued giving him one tuna-flavored capsule each day, sprinkled over his food, as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration, all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication. I would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis; and buying it from Amazon saved me about 2/3 of the cost from the vet. 
I have used this vacuum only on carpet, as I bought it for my finished basement.    Suction is very powerful, it is quiet, and the dirt cup is so easy to empty.  The cup is designed so that you push a lever, and it empties from the bottom - very clever and so easy and clean.  It is a large dirt cup so it holds a lot.  Other nice features include a very long cord, and great looks!  The most important thing is suction, and this baby is POWERFUL!!  It's amazing what this thing picks up.  Overall, extremely pleased with this vacuum! 
My only complant is that the cord is shorter then I am used to. But I guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind. This feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly.  It sucks great, is easy to clean, and light weight. The price is fantastic 
We bought our French skillet two years ago, and it has yet to even have one scratch on the cooking surface. It can go in the dishwasher, and although we usually hand wash it, it is nice to know that easy clean up is possible. It gets used in our house every day, and is very durable. I am planning on purchasing more for my family! We also have a covered pan and a six inch pan that we use almost as much. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed in this pan 
None of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff! I bought this and the 8" fry pan 2 months ago and, except for the bottoms, still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day. I even used a bacon press (cast iron) in it every time I cooked bacon and a couple of times I accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left. Hubby stacked knives and forks inside, then topped it off with 6 dinner plates. I thought it was done for--scratches and nicks everywhere, but no, not a single mark. My Calphalon Commercial nonstick (which hit the trash already) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr. old did that. I must admit, though, that I do not use metal utensils in it, nor do I put in a dishwasher since I won't have one til the kitchen is remodeled. Overall, though, just from what abuse it has gotten, I'm very impressed and will buy more. My advice? Don't mess with the rest--buy the best and this is it. Going to try the wok next. Wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it 
I ordered 6 thinking I was getting 6 washcloths.  Little did I know that they were two to a package and I got 12.  What a special surprise.  These are the thickest washcloths I have ever had including those I paid a bundle for at "exclusive" stores.  I am so happy with them every time I use them.  They have never faded or left lint.  Thanks for a wonderful product 
This is probably one of the best blade grinders out there.  The top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup, eliminating the scoop step.  It has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate, along with cup amounts.  The amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on, however.  Anyways, bottom line:  it grinds great with little mess.  
My mother had a set of Franciscan Apple dinnerware as I was growing up, though I never thought too much about what I was eating off of at the time.  Later, as a wife and mother myself, I was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen.  We had just moved to Appleton, WI (16 years ago) so I decided to use an &quot;apple&quot; theme, w/o even connecting the idea with my mom's dishes.  I was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the Franciscan dishes. Over the years I've collected innumerable apple items, but my goal is to have a set of Franciscan apple dishes of my own!  They do chip, but they last forever and retain their color beautifully 
keeps the tank warm for my little fish friend 
It's a very secure for children. My daughter is happy with this produc 
This is an excellent product. If you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium, and making huge messes, walking in puddles, etc..and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks, this product is for you. Don't waste your money on cheap suction devices, and buy the python today! (sorry if I sound like an infomercial, I'm just an enthusiastic user). The python attaches to your faucet, you turn the water on full blast, stick the suction tube end into your tank, and you can drain your tank in minutes, or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes. Then, you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up (again, in minutes). I have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon, as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank, and what used to take me a whole day, now takes about an hour (to do all tanks). I like that I can vacuum the gravel, boy does this thing suck the waste up. This will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great! I was skeptical that this product would work, but am so glad that I bought it. Now I actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it.   The directions are easy to follow~ even for people like me, who are "direction impaired." 
I had a small version of salad shooter, it was great, used it for so many years, but now the blade was dull, and I kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them. I decided the next salad shooter I buy should be slightly larger. So I bought this salad shooter professional series, which is great, having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day: multiple cones to change, large feeding place for the veggy, fast, light, eassy to clean including in the dishwasher,still small enough to store in small spaces,efortless to cut and shread your veggy, no need for knife and cutting board. What I like the most about this product is the fact that when I put veggy in it to be cut, shread..., the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut, so I do not have to push it in, probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades. This way your work is done in no time. In my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen.        
Admittedly, I am a bit of a knife-buying nut.  I love kitchen knives and own chef's knives and santuko knives from Wusthof, Henckels, Kyocera and Furi. This Calphalon Katana 6-inch chef's knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance-wise.  I like the way the handle is shaped, it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious.  I love the way it looks too!  For the price, I'd say you can't go wrong. I really like it a lot!  I have only had it for a few weeks though, but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we'll see how well it resharpens when the need arises. 
I have this bowl and the larger one. They are perfect bowls for mixing. The rubber base really helps the bowl stay put. I was them in the dishwasher without any problems 
This is a good Bat house but doesn't come with a pole. I would recomend buying a pole or just hanging it somewhere 
I bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills, I thought this one seemed to have the better reviews, so I bought it.  I really love it. It heats up pretty quickly, and has enough space for 2-3 people 4 people would have to eat slower, but it does have enough broiler space, and its square to have people at all 4 sides.  We use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal.  The only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say.  Most of it comes off very easily, but some spots of cooked grease remain, it comes of with some elbow grease, and a scrubby, but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was 
I have used this for treaditional recipies as well as with different ethnic twists..korean bbq, seafood, italian roasted peppers, artichokes, etc.We have used potatoes & bread for topping with goodies..the possibilites are truely endless.. The grill is easy set up, and easy clean up..very family friendly 
I bought this Espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk. It is great if you like to make lattes. Or just plain expressos. It brews fast, less than two minutes.    It makes a great Cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like Pilon or Bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans.  I do not use Italian roast because I do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes.  
Having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan, as the tittle says:  Pay the 3-4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead.  I'm using the preseasoned more because it is just ready.    Keep in mind its large and heavy.  Careful in your sink.  Coming from stainless steel and converted over to Calphalon ( mostly bought all pieces from Amazon.com ), if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me.    Heat kills everything.  If you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water / salt / scrubbing..  and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark, then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with.  But we all pay for convience and these pans I use mostly to sear meat.  With a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives, get the preseasoned.  
Recently purchased this in mid-2006 and it is the best cookware item I have ever owned and used.  As one of those millions who rely on mid-line priced discount department store brands, I can state with 100% certainty I was amazed (and still am) with the high-performance this item offers!  The clean-up is still a dream-come-true, all I have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse, it practically cleans itself.  My burners are all equal size (gas stove) and highest setting is "6" I have learned all I have to do for pancakes is level 3!!  Cooking bacon, an entire pound, is no problem for this cookware.  I do want to purchase more of this item, there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available.  I'm even thinking of slowly switching to this brand "All-Clad" nonstick 
I am a contractor and when I recently remodeled Doug and Susans basement I was eventually shown how to use the grinder to make espresso while on breaks.  Unfortunately, I started taking lots of breaks... good espresso!  The grinder is quiet, precise,and efficient, like an excellent sub contractor, or a good table saw!  The grinder was great.  I use a burr grinder at my house but you can't even talk over the thing.  This one whirs below a conversation level, then stores the suberbly consistant ground coffee.  I then pull the lever a couple times to dispense premeasured amounts into the doser that is resting in its holder on the machine, and there it is break is on!!  Thanks for the good times and good espresso.  On my way to hawk some of my tools to buy one of these things, it's worth it 
After going through several Nathan's cheap stovetop grilles. I realized,that although I love grilling food, I needed a good grill pan. I did not wish upon a star but a dream came true with this marvelous cooking aid. I use it evry day, It NRVER sticks and the heat is so evenly distrubuted that everything comes out perfect! It also is a handsome addition to my kitchen. 
She asked for the little CrockPot. By golly, she got the little CrockPot 
i heard that tab water in baltimore city isnt good for health, so i decided to by this water filter. this item makes tab water drinkable. it removes bad smell and taste of tab water. i also read that it filters many different things. because it is designed to be fit in the door side, i could organize well 
This timer is great. Light enough to wear around when you do your 15 minutes of cleaning and FLYing! Keeps excellent time. Magnet is good to put on fridge, or on any metal cupboard. I love it! best for the $$ 
Hang this around your neck and you won't forget that next basting or turning on the grill or stove.  Good loud ring, easy to set, and no batteries needed.  Had one for four years and it keeps on working 
T-Fal is an excellent quality and a good buy.  Nice, heavy pan and very "non-stick".  Now I just have to find a lid to fit it's large size! 
This is my first "electric" litter box.  I have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up.  It really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box.  It was a breeze to set up.  I also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor. And with the tent they can't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a BM on the floor.  I'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down 
Great product at a great price. The first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item.  Thank you 
My husband and I fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza. A Tombstone pizza fits great on this plate 
I bought this sauce pan last week. The quality is very good. The handle design is quite comfortable. I tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan. I found no hot spot. It responded to the change in the heat setting is average. It's kind of heavier than All-Clad LTD for the same size of pan. I'm not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet. For the initial impression, this Calphalon One Non-stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as All-Clad - LTD, Stainless steel, MC2. Look for the bargain. It's worth the cost 
This is a great cookie sheet. I chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum, and because I know it's durable. My mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago, and when I compared the two, mine was much heavier, and better quality. I would highly recommend this pan - especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and I was able to get 2 of these, along with 2 of the 9" round cake pans from  this company, for only $30! A great deal 
This is a very nice piece of furniture.  Well built, good quality.  It was shipped via UPS and the box was quite damaged when it arrived.  Thank goodness for good packaging, or it would have been destroyed.  One of the doors did have a crack in it and a new door is to be shippped shortly.  A new mode of shipping should be considered.    
I've already reviewed the Miele vacuum cleaner itself, along with the Turbo brush, so I'm a fan of the pricy-but-worth-it-if-you-can-afford-it sucker. If you're reading this, you're probably one too, so I'm not gonna talk about the vacuum cleaner on a net page selling the bags.  I'm just going to relate information on the box about what Miele vacuums this goes with, on the theory that's the main question you have. It's not entertaining, but perhaps it's useful:  S241 - S256 i S290 - S291 S300 i - S399 S500 - S578 S700 - S758 S4000 - S4999  The box comes with 5 bags (they;re strong, I've discovered), 1 dust compartment filter, and one "super air clean filter."  Miele uses a HEPA filter, known for its allegy protection. Long-lasting, worth it 
We bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand, that after 2+ years was no longer bouncing back into shape.  This Serta topper is just fine, as comfortable as our last one.  My big complaint is that someone at Serta (though Serta isn't the actual manufacturer) needs to measure a queen sized bed, because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides.  If you place the topper in the included protective cover, it's several inches short on all 4 sides.  I know 1 inch sounds minor, but if you're a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed, the topper doesn't protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress.  As far as toppers in general, we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed.  You don't feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper (though presumably with a full Tempur bed isolates even more).  Definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford, and the thickest you can afford 
I bought this as a Christmas present for a dear friend of mine who recently began collecting rooster objects.  The entire set arrived in perfect condition.  The colors, red & black are vibrant and striking..the rooster pattern is on each piece and is very nice.      Very good quality, good size and good price...will make a perfect holiday gift for serving pasta or stew or salad or whatever 
I check out all the local stores for a glass-lined Carafe, but could find none. This is a great product. Keeps coffee hot (especially when primed with hot water first) 
After several tries and telephone calls to my brother; I finally have the blade in the correct position (I had problems with the directions in the book). It works great now.  A reminder to oil the blades before you put the machine away; they rust easily if damp 
This is a GREAT product.  It really holds a lot and is great for stoups (thicker than soup but thinner than stews) and can hold meats like a pork tenderloin quite easily 
I've used this for Indian food and it worked really well - you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala.  BTW I own other Anolon Advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup.  Re: the squishy handle. If you have gripping problems, as many middle age to older cooks do, this helps you.  Don't listen to the young, self-involved, and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature.  Some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature 
This purchase came with 3 stackable racks - I thought it was only one rack. It stores very easily in a compact space and works well. I don't know if it rusts since I have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it 
This is, hands-down, the best hair removal tool on the market. It grabs an astounding amount of undercoat and topcoat hair. Just one usage of it on my dog cut his shedding by at least 75%. Regarding the complaints: Yes, hair will go all over the place, but that's stated in the instructions; use it in an area where you can sweep or vacuum 
This is one amazing tool. We went from vacuuming 3 times a week to once a week. We simply can't believe the difference. The dog seems to love it, too. I don't have to work on him as long or hard or often as I did with the standard rake. I am a fan FURever 
I like this winged corkscrew but I had to repair the plastic once when the cap near the wings busted off. Superglue did the job, and I haven't had trouble since 
It really does make a difference when some of the chlorine is filtered out of your coffee (and even more so in your bourbon) water, but these filters are a rip off price-wise.  It's hard to believe Braun wouldn't make money selling them at a third of the price 
It is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels:-) What you probably don't see on the picture well, it stands on plastic, so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding. Has really easy refill-no mess, no fuss, and you can always see when you need to buy pepper. I don't think there is better pepper grinder out there. Others I saw are certainly better looking, artsy, whatever, but this one is the most useful! 
I love this carafe - it is perfect for making flavored water with sliced lemons, limes & oranges. The narrow neck means that the fruit won't fall into your glass while you are pouring and the fruit staying put also means it can steep in the water longer...YU 
These bowls are a perfect size for holding one portion.  Much better than plastic containers that melt in the microwave.  I use one almost every day for taking  my lunch to work.  At $2.99 it more than pays for itself every time you use it (verses buying a take out lunch). 
I had high hopes for these 600-thread count sheets and they've exceeded every one of them.  They perfectly fit my oversize king.  After 5 washes now they are as soft as ever.  Sleeping on these sheets is simply wonderful 
Excellent, when you want to bake a small cake this is absolutely a great small just the right size of a cake form 
This is a great pan.  I have a larger one, but this one fits in my pressure cooker.  Makes a wonderful cream cheese cake in the pressure cooker 
I love this item. Perfect for storing Pet Food. Special Screw type tops that seals food.  Bugs, Mice Cannot get in.  Easy to wash, let it air dry.  My only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it.  So those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed.  Over all the best in Food Storage.  I know i just about bought them all 
to go with my original finish Lodge cookware, but this one didn't take any effort to season.  Good going, Lodge 
I went on a hunt for these glasses for a friend after our having beverages in them in a (now gone) bar in NYC.  I was delighted to finally find the exact glass at, what I think is, an affordable price for the quality.  I bought a set and we ended up "splitting" them (he only wanted/had space for 4 - he lives in a small! apartment). I love them so much I've now put them on my wishlist.  The beautiful clear glass, clean design and impressive heft makes them feel elegant, special and expensive.  I'm *certain* the shape and feel make the single-malt scotch I prefer taste even better!  An excellent value at less than $40 for six 
I was looking for a tool to process the exotic fruit I grow, and Amazon had the largest selection 
The pot rack was just the right size and color. It looks great in my kitchen without creating a barrier between my kitchen and dining room. I love how easy it was to hang and the number of links provided with it mean that it can hang really low if I want. This is just perfect for my kitchen 
These are so adorable! The patterns are too cute, and they can be mixed and matched just like boring cups and saucers. They even make me happy when I see them in the cabinet. They are a great shape and size! I am inspired to upgrade my espresso machine because these only deserve the best! 
There's nothing worse than having to find space for, and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it. Henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop, and because she's on the countertop, you will use her. She works great. Will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling. I tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs, but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me. She poaches four eggs perfectly, and here, you can use jumbos if you like. The water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her, if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done, adding more or less water the next time will take care of that. Actually, the first time I poached jumbos, I found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste; I added a bit more water to the cooker, plugged her back in, and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute. When the water evaporates, she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing (as I am). I love this cooker. First one I have ever owned. And because she looks cute sitting on the counter, I don't forget I have her; therefore, she gets used alot 
Have owned the Jura Capresso E8 since July of 2006. Have made over 750 coffees since that day. Heavy entertaining and daily latte's bring value to the machine.  Machine has responded well under all circumstances. Only problem thus far has been with the frother which would jam from the froth to steam position.  Contacted Capresso and the expressed a new attachment. Have had no additional issues with machine thus far.   Excellent crema  and good temperature for espresso. ( Warm the expresso cups before hand )  As with other machines I have owned, experimentation with coffee to milk ratio takes some time. Once determined the machine makes a consistent brew each time.   Have run cleaning cycles and filter changes when prompted. Machine really is super-automatic. The machine informs you when water is needed, when beans need to be filled and when grounds need to be emptied.   Would recommend the machine without hesitation. Should this change I will update the review.    
I bought this glass for my wife (who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine) as a Christmas gift.  Last night, she tried out the glass with a friend.  The reviews from both of them were quite something to watch.  The wine from this glass tasted far, far superior to the same wine from an "ordinary" red wine glass.  In fact, they poured the remaining wine from the "ordinary" glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening.  There was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different, superior one 
We love this item, it's easy for the kids and everyone who visits asks us where we found them. They look cute in the kitchen too! 
I bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning, and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day. This is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves. Some of the Honeycombs get a little crushed, but I've found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them. Reese's Puffs and Cheerios also came out without any crushing. You have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh. Maybe this was in the directions, but I missed it and learned the hard way. But the kids figured out the caps easily and it's not a big deal for them 
Excellent for Fall & Spring here in Florida. Fans have a reversible switch which is very handy (don't have to turn the whole fan around) 
I've been a chef for almost 15 years, and a knife is one of the tools I reach out most of the time.  During those years I've used all kinds of brands including Kershaw, Wusthof, Mundial and even Smart and Final brand.  And to be more specific, an 8 inch chef's knife is my favorite.  After having fun with these toys, I thought it's time to reward myself with an ultimate gift. So I sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive.  One day I came across the Shun Classic on the Amazon Web. This knife sets itself apart from the others: the simplicity in design, the beauty of the blade, the sharpness, and finally its steel quality.  The blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from  layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a Samurai's Sword, WOW!  The D shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood, it fits in my hand nicely.  But the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness.  I can slice pieces of lemons micro thin!  It's not only super sharp, but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels I experienced with.  It weighs a little heavier, but I'm sure that's not a big deal for me. Cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there isn't any corner which will accumulate grease.  Shun 8 inch Classic is the best I've ever had.  You won't regret what you pay for even though the price is very high.  A good chef deserves a good steel.  
This lovely salad set will be a great addition to any lunch or dinner setting.  The serving bowl is much larger than I anticipated -- and great for tossing space.  The individual bowls are also deep.  This is a great  set for salad lovers 
This new toaster from Kitchen Aid is an excellent little toaster, and includes a special setting for Bagel's as well as settings for frozen items like toaster waffels. I love mine and tell everyone in my family they should have one. If your looking for a new toaster you cannot fine a better one than this model from Kitchen Aid 
This works great on tile grout! it would be nice if it worked good on the glass shower doors but it didn't Not bad for the price. It does take a long time to get the job done. 
The filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier.  It works really well.  
I bought this for my husband's birthday b/c I watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there. Carafes that leak, coffeemakers that don't keep the right temperature, etc...  This is the kind of coffee you get at a 5-star restaurant. In fact, they  probably use a Bunn.  The design is utilitarian-not decoration, and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee 
The grill is a significant improvement over my previous Weber in regards to: -grill area -regidity of the cast iron grill -control for raising or lowering goals -large charcoal shelf -three compartments within the charcoal shelf -heavy guage metal construction -the option of adding a rotisserie The grill is wanting in regards to: -lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill -lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals 
These cup are enormous! (Not to mention beautiful, in that fun and elegant way that only Fiestaware can be.) I was looking for a very large, oversized mug because I drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly. I definately got my wish. I have eaten soup and cereal out of these, I even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently. Very cute! I plan on getting them in all of the six colors I have in Fiestaware. Let me tell you again, this cup is HUGE 
I odered this item as housewarming gift, the box has open display of 5 piece hostess set and 5 piece place settings, you can see and touch without open the box! they are beautiful chess design. some people doesn't care flatware  using the right way and after write negative review. following this recomendations will result in the enjoyment of your J.A Henckels flatware for many years; 1. DO NOT ALLOW ACIDIC FOODS TO REMAIN IN CONTACT AFTER USE such as mustard, ketchup. lemon. etc  rinse all flatware that have been in contact with the above foods before placing in the dishwasher.  2, do not use detergents containing chlorides or a high lemon content.  3. do not soak for extended periods of time with tap water in the sink get rusting or spots.  4. in the dishwasher use a drying cycle.  100% RECOMMENDED ! 
I am extremely pleased with the Anolon cookware set.  It cooks evenly and cleans up beautifully. Many of my friends recommended this set and I'm glad to have taken their advice and made the purchase 
After reading the other reviews, I almost reconsidered my purchase.  However, the juicer works great - as long as you follow a few tips.  1) Make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on TIGHT!  Check once, then check again. 2) Don't use the paper filters, particularly if you are juicing in quantity.  Once I threw mine in the trash, the balancing issues went away immediately.  It makes clean up a little harder, but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use, it's not a big deal. 3) If the item being juiced won't go through, be patient, and pulse-push it in.  Don't cram it with the pusher.  My only concern is that when you juice quantities, so much pulp sticks to the side it's hard for all of the juice out to strain out.  It's best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice.  Using the above tips - I expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time 
I was hesetant about ordering these after reading some of the other reviews on how fragile these glasses are.  I am very pleased that I did order them.  I am enjoying them very much.  They are fragile, but if you handle them with care, I'm sure they will last a long time.  I even put mine in the dishwasher and have had no problems 
I have purchased other syrup dispensers in the past, and all of them broke.  Usually the thumb lever jams with dried syrup.  This one is a unique design that appears to prevent this problem.  And, it even comes with an extra O-ring :- 
This is great, it is very easy to clean, just put it in the dishwasher. You never have to worry about getting Honey or Syrup all over again. It pours very clean and doesn't drip after you're done. It looks very nice too. Great Deal with a classy look 
I owned this dispenser for close to a year, and love it.  The cereal is always fresh and accessible and I do not have to keep the boxes or reach out to grab few nuts for a quick snack.  Great design 
We have tried a variety of knife sharpeners and they didn't work very well. Finally, I purchased this item and we have been quite pleased ever since. Friends even ask to use it.  If you need sharp knives for cooking then this item is a great purchase. The cost may seem higher than most but well worth the quality and it really sharpens both serrated and straight knives.  Easy to use and nice addition to a kitchen where you enjoy cooking.  
We were very skeptical.  One of our cats would mark certain spots (like corners) occassionaly.  But we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room! It got so bad that we had to discard the rug.  We tried Boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day, but the one time we forgot to spray, he would mark again.  We were at our wits end and decided to try Feliway.  We bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots.  At first we also used the Boundary, but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn't see any urine markings anymore.  It took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work.  Our cat even appears more calm and pleasant.  We make sure that we replace the container of Feliway every 5 weeks or so.  It's well worth the money 
Pros: I have two Chocolate Labs, therefore, I have a lot of hair to deal with.  The vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt (wood floors).  It works alright on rugs.  Cons: Not cheap. Loud. The plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you can't carry it, you just have to roll it instead. Not a big deal 
These pans are made by Ekco and durable.  The nice thing is they do not brown the edges like the tephlon coated ones.  Just be sure to use wax paper on the bottom and they will come out with ease 
I took a chance on ordering these, and I'm glad I did.  They are heavy-duty!  I like the handles as I do a lot of microwave cooking and it's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware.  I've also used these in a convection oven, and them seem to work really great!  I picked the "Sapphire" color, and they are very attractive on the table as well!  
I was surprised by the quick delivery.  I opened the box to check the bowls.  Everything was intact and I was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present 
We recently moved, and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment.  One cat, usually friendly and playful, would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment.  The other cat, usually very docile, was being overly aggressive during "play time" with the other cat and with us.  After buying the Comfort Zone plug-in, we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week.  Both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal - more friendly and playful, less anxious and aggressive.  The only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug-in vial will last 4 weeks, but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3.  But maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left.  It is hard to judge when the plug-in actually ran out because the cats' behavior did not change, even after I unplugged the diffuser 
Having used Hoover products in a commercial environment for many years I have had great service from them, providing many years of dependable and powerful operation.  We were excited to try out this "new" Hoover model.  One of the first things I have noticed about it over the previous Windtunnel Model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum.  This may bother some, but I see it as a testament to it's improved build quality over the Gen.1 Windtunnel.  This machine is very powerful and it's dual turbine motor has a confident sound.  I'll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is.  It is a nice feature though. I'll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is.  **UPDATE**  After having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences...  Two very glaring problems with the machine are that it   1) Lacks a bag full indicator.  The bag filled on this machine, and then busted (unknowlingly) at the top around the bag collar.  "Stuff" went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter.  It took another vacuum to clean the mess up.  In the future I will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle, indicating how full the bag is getting.  2)  The cord rewinder is a nice feature, but truly lacks quality.  It will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance.  A stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference.  3)  Dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head, not that it presents a problem, but it's unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust.  Beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns.  
I do most of the vacuuming. My wife's only request when I went looking for a new model was that it use a bag. She absolutely hates the bagless models and doesn't want to see what we're pulling up. We have two dogs (an Akita and a Golden Retriever) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day. So after searching I find this model. I researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me I take the plunge and order it from Amazon. Now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and I was shocked when it arrived in 4. The big thing I like about this unit is that the bags it uses (although a little hard to find)have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt. The unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well. And boy does it clean! Our rugs look fantastic! One complaint I have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off. Another would be that you cannot turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position..I know its a safety feature..I just don't like it. The pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades. The little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas.  Overall I would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from Amazon was so positive that I've purchased other items and make it my first place to look now 
 I received the 10 pc set from my husband for Christmas.  I have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use. Some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans. Maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them. The pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly. I feel we made a good choice 
This Rice Cooker has a non-stick bowl, which makes clean-up a cinch! The indicator light is red when cooking and green when warming. It cooks the rice perfectly every time. Also this cooker is small and easy to store. 
I love this -  had seen items like it and so broke down.  Now I am sorry I have not had one for years and year 
It was a Christmas gift, truly enjoyed by my grandson who loves to cook (with supervision).  It's easy to store, and able to keep the oil in its container for several uses.  Bigger than the GranDaddy so you can cook more at one time.  It's great.  Have one myself and it has been with us for years.  
I bought this when my air popper died & I am so glad I found this product!  The popcorn is the best & it is very simple to make.  The thing I like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn.  I can choose which oil to use & how much so I have total control over what goes into my popcorn so I feel confident that what I am eating is good for me.    The packaged corn that came with was ok & a good introduction to using the popper but I will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own.  I did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book & it was fantastic!  I would recommend this to anyone, the popper is easy to handle, easy to clean & it makes the best, crisp & crunchy popcorn ever.  It only takes about 3 minutes to be done & you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings.  Sometimes simple & old fashioned is better & that is the case with this item.  Now we can't wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night!    
Due to the slits around the opening, this label will fit a wide variety of neck sizes including Burgundy and those odd Rosemount Shiraz necks.  I would like it better if it were more of a plastic coated paper since I think it would hold up longer in a cellar, but at least it fits all my bottles.  The others I've purchased don't 
WE LOVE THIS CRATE FOR OUR PUG, BUT SHE IS A SMART LITTLE DOG.  SHE HAS LEARNED HOW TO GET THE ZIPPER ON THE END UNDONE AND ESCAPE.  OF COURSE, WHEN SHE DOES THIS NO ONE IS HOME AND WE FIND SMALL GIFTS LEFT BEHIND 
This Soup Pot is an excellent addition to any cook's set of tools.  Using this pot, there's no need to saute meats of veggies in one place and then transfer them to an ovenproof pot to finish.  It goes easily from stovetop or oven to the table and is compatible with almost any dinnerware.  Can you tell  I really like my new Soup Pot 
I bought these for a wonderful craft.  I was expecting them to be decent, but I did not expect them to be as nice as they were.  If I realized how nice they were, then I would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping.  I realize that I got 100 bags, but my craft took about 75 of them.  They are nicer than the piping/icing bags that I used while I was learning cake decorating.  When these are gone, I will definitely order more. The plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out. 
I have tried sooo many different roti/tortilla makers. and this SAACHI is seriously the BEST out there!  Bargainoffers.com company is the best!  They have great customer service and are such nice people.  I have tried the crappy villaware 10 inch model as well as the horrible 8 inch REVEL brand, and i had nothing but problems.  They stick and dont heat up well enough.  The saachi is great, never had a problem, EVER! 
Great item, just what I needed.  The price was fine and the company reputation was a serious consideration in my selection 
Blinds were what I expected.  They were very good quality and low price too.  Shipping was excellent and on time.  
This color is a bit too bright, but the bag it very comfortable 
The Nordic Ware Sunflower pan is just what I wanted.  It came in perfect condition and in a very timely fashion.  Thank you 
Great honing steel that is a bit longer than others I looked at (seems to help a bit for the bigger knives) and an attractive taper (not sure that matters, but it looks nice).  I've only had it a brief time, though I've used it frequently.  Despite an occasional clumsy collision, this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks.  It straightens the edge on my (mostly) mid-grade knives with ease.  Another reviewer claimed the handle was plastic.  Perhaps he was mistaken, or perhaps he had a different version.  But mine, purchased later, has a visible grain if you look close, under a dark ebony finish.  It does almost "feel" plastic due to the hard resin finish, but it is the same material as on the Shun knives a friend has (though the steel lacks the metal endcap that her knives have).  Aesthetics are open to debate, but I think it looks much nicer than most, and performs better than any other I've used for daily straightening.  For less frequent light sharpening, I recommend a diamond steel.  Global makes the best diamond steel I've seen, but I've stuck with the DMT for a quarter the price 
This knife along w/the matching 7" 5-star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb, prime rib, ham, veal, turkey, etc...at various carving stations at my job. I love the 5-star line & have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife. I'd recomend trying the 4-star & pro-s line out as well before deciding on this line(same blades, different handles). I'd definately replace if lost/stolen. After using proper tools there's no way you can go back to cheap knives. I'd love to see a 12" version of this knife w/a wider blade 
What a fabulous pillow and a great deal.  They looked small until I unpacked them, then POOF! Big fluffy pillows!  Nice 
I have two kittens which are spoiled rotten and have more toys than they can ever wish for.  This is by far one of their favorites.  They love the moving ball and use the center scratch area often (keeps them off the furniture and other areas.) I know they play with it daily.  Very reasonably priced and definitely a must for cats!!   
My husband received a similar bag for Christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer.  We are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine.  The black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we don't have to worry about the bottom falling out.  The material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well 
This DeLonghi BAR32 Espresso Maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that I can find that does not have aluminum its water/coffee path.  The boiler, porta-filter & baskets, brew group, and steam wand are all stainless steel (albeit the wand has a plastic tip).    I thought the Capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler  might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta-filter itself is made of aluminum (although it does have stainless basket inserts) and is TWICE THE PRICE than the Delonghi BAR32. It is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta-filter after exiting the stainless baskets - although Capresso implies no in their Ads.  
Looks and works just as advertised. Took it out of the box and used it the day we received it, made for a lovely and lively family dinner. Great buy 
Holds everything.  Makes perfect pot roasts.  I use all clad MC2 for most cooking, but when I need to braise I use this -- I love it 
This product is a must have for anyone serious about baking.  This mixer is by far the best appliance that I have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course.  I reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake.  The 5 quart + was worth the money, don't buy the 4 qt, save the money and purchase the 5, you'll be glad that you did 
Works great, it is a lot easier than using paper filters 
I have several Oxo spatulas - they don't warp, bend, peel, discolor or melt - even if used to stir things in a hot pan.  So far, none of them have broken, and I have had several of them for a few years.  Great quality 
I very much like THIS Sommlier glass but they are quite fragile.  A significantly better choice for everyday use is the Schott Zwiesel Diva line of glasses.  Granted, the Riedel glass is thinner at the rim but man, for my dollar, the Schott glasses are a steal 
This is probably my favorite mug. It easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup. It comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim. The best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over. Even hard corners don't seem to phase it. It's also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat's efforts to tip it over.   The odd shape also has downsides though. It won't fit in any cup holder I've ever come across, but that doesn't matter much since it won't tip over no matter where you set it. If you don't rinse it out immediately, it can be difficult to clean later, due to the shape; if you don't have small hands, you may need a bottle cleaning brush. Also, I imagine if you had more than one of these mugs, they'd be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space. Despite this, it's still a great mug. In fact I'm going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too 
I was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting. I found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try.  It does a perfect job! I owned the original model when it first came out years ago. This one is more streamlined and improved.  The Dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups. 
Yep, I had some 20-year-old Revere Ware pots and this steamer fit my 2 qt pan with no problem. And the lid from the pan fit the steamer. It's plenty big to steam two large sweet potatoes, and probably more. Exactly what I needed and the price was good too 
This bread slicer is quite good.  It has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it.  It cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized Loaves.  I have found though, that if I bake the largest size loaf, the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after I slice a few slices I am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container.  
wife loves this contraption.  if you like your coffee or tea strong you need to use more than usuall.  easy to  clean. and the best part is that amazon sent me two of them when I purchased one.  sweet.  cup it comes with is great quality.  peace! 
I am potty training my son, so I needed a good waterproof mattress pad but didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This fits the bill.  It's lightweight but sturdy, and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress, and held up well in the wash so far.  Has a nice feel, and it doesn't seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do.  Our mattress is old and thin by today's standards, but the pad seems roomy enough that I think if we got a new thick mattress, it would still work.  Very pleased with this purchase 
Love it!  Fluffy, warm, and light.  Perfect for snuggling up into on those cold, blustery days or for building a make-shift fort.  :)  Big enough to comfortably cover (and keep warm) many people.  And it's wonderfully light, so it doesn't bog you down while you sleep.  Wonderful 
This is essentially the All-Clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles.  The "dutch oven" sold by All-Clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1/2 quart saucier.  This is a versatile stovetop pan--wide enough for frying, deep enough for liquids, good-looking enough to carry to the table.  It can also slide into the oven when needed.    It may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet, with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans, as one poster complained, but it functions quite well as an "everyday pan" for up to 4 persons.  The dimensions of 9 1/2 inches by 3 inches (plus handles) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape, with a rounded bottom for easy stirring.  If you are looking for a versatile "do-it-all" pan, this is a good choice 
I searched for months for a stylish, durable set of flatware at a bargain price, and this is it!  I was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a Friday sale.  The design is unique and contemporary, and the finish and weight are of excellent quality.  The only criticism that I have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons - the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher.  However, this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous, inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come.  
We purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago.  It has held up so well, that I just purchased ten more place settings (the Friday only sale) to use for entertaining.  Our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day.  This flatware is heavy and really nice to hold, (the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from).  The super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions.  
Have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers, London broil, steaks.  It produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use.  The cooking grate can only be set at two levels: standing on its posts or inverted, lying on the rim of the firebox.  The level must be chosen before you start cooking, which presents a problem for some preparations.  The damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature.  Emptying ash is a bit awkward, as you need to remove the doors and coal grate, then lift and tip the firebox, which is heavy.  The lip catches some ash, so it is difficult to completely empty.  Be sure to set the grill on a pan, as grease will leak through and collect around the legs 
I see a lot of people have leaky shakers.  Not me.  Mine is absolutely perfect.  The top/strainer piece fits snugly, leak-free, requiring just the right amount of effort to de-couple it from the canister.  The design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister.  The lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top.  The cap/jigger also fits perfectly, with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily 
I have no kitchen stove so I have been relying on this little champ for everything from tea to pasta (before South Beach Diet) to making eggs in the morning, etc. I have owned this unit for over 3 years and have NEVER ONCE had a problem with it. Awesome for a college student or a person with a tiny apartment such as mine. Also great for taking to work. It is a bit hard to clean and there is not too much area to touch to move it while it is still cooling down. Other than that, I highly recommend it. I am here today to buy the DOUBLE version and I can only hope that it performs as well as it's little sister. Enjoy!!! - Li 
I use this mug a lot for chicken noodle and other soups as well as salads.  Its easy to clean up and to handle.  I like having the lid with the pop top so its doesn't make a mess in the microwave.  I fits easily in the tote bag when commuting to work.  I highly recommend it!! 
After much research and consideration I decided to buy this product as a Christmas gift for my husband.  I am not the type of person to research products before I buy them, but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso (and being Cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth--makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines), I did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations. I have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it.  My main concern was how HOT the coffee would be, and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee.  I've read reviews about the noise it makes, and after having the Deloghi product, the noise this machine makes when warming up is NOT that loud at all.  We are very happy with it.  Buy it, you'll be happy too 
I didn't know which maker I wanted, it was hard making up my mind.  I finally chose this one and boy did I make the right choice. It works great, better than I could have hoped for.  Cookies turned out wonderful and it was fast and easy 
This soap dish is beautiful, practical and sturdy. Best of all, it will retain all water and liquid soap leftovers in its tray, leaving your bathroom clean and dry.  Recommended.  
I bought 2 of these and they are so soft and comfy.  I love these blankets.  They are so superior to other blankets in their price range.  The main reason I bought them was the price; the colors are very nice too 
I have two of these, one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color.  They're attractive, of course; this is Fiestaware, after all.  But they're darn functional.  They're long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs, and they're deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you're carrying or serving.  I like wish there was one slightly bigger too; then I'd get two more 
This product is great to have on hand. In the past, I've used purchased yogurt as a starter, but this eliminates the need to run to the grocery store when you want to make yogurt. After a small delivery snafu, the company immediately sent me a replacement. They also sent me a follow up e-mail just to make sure that I received the product (thanks Fred!!! 
This timer was a Christmas gift for Mom. She loved it. She thought it was very cute 
This core is remarkable. It is so easy to use, just fill it with cake batter and insert it in the cake pan. Pour the remaining batter in the pan and large cakes come out wonderful. This heating core allowed by daughters half sheet cake to come out perfect 
Love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh.  This one holds a larger amount than others I have had.  It is a bit more awkward to hold, however.  It has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up. Love the Emile Henry colors 
Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated.  Nice furniture and practical book shelves.  But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around.  It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying.  But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water.  
THIS 2 QT BOWL HAS MANY USES . I USE IT FOR MIXING , SERVING AND BAKING.  IT IS WONDERFUL FOR MACARONI AND CHEESE , ALSO HAVE DONE  COBBLERS .   I HAVE 6 DIFFERENT COLORS . ONCE YOU GET ONE YOU WILL HAVE TO  GET ANOTHER AND ANOTHER  
Not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter, but I previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home. This cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust. It is really useful on those thick pizzas, like spinach and feta. Plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board. I almost never use it for any non-pizza cooking, and a heavy, sharp knife works almost as well. However, it's a fun item, and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza, I definitely recommend it 
Absolutely FAB!!! Shiny-bright stainless steel, matches Frieling French Press, and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly! Just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so...of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers. Overall these are just VERY sturdy/solid, clean-up beautifully and very easily, and, by the way, the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar, and sets inside the little 'notched' area of the lower bowl, so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple, yet European-engineered, well-thought out design & quality. I fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down...although it's a l-o-o-o-ng time until I'll be distributing my assets! Make sure to buy the matching Frieling French Press- it's just incredible, & also heirloom quality! Give yourself the gift of European quality coffeeware- it's one of life's simple, yet indispensible indulgences!  PS the Frieling French Coffee Press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too 
I'm really happy with this shoe rack.  I'd like it to be a little bit taller, but it holds the shoes very effectively and fits well in my closet.  I'd definitely recommend it 
This shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble! This hold alot of shoes and spins really nice, I Have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11's fit just fine! This Shoe Rack Is Perfect, I Highly Reccomend It! 
I have these sheets on my bed right now.  They are very comfortable and soft after just one washing.  The price was great and the striping addds style to otherwise bland white sheets 
I bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it. It is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved. I definitely recommend it. I just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special. 
How did this technology elude me for so many years? After spending decades of trying to "bring the butter up to room temp" by, variously, taking it out hours before I needed to use it, placing it on the warm radiator, zapping it in the microwave, or putting it in a dish of hot water, finally I've found a way to keep the butter spreadable and fresh!  Few kitchen aids are as useful as this one. I would rank this up there in the top-ten list along with my 8" Wusthof blade, 3" Chinatown-special drain mesh, Pyrex measuring cup, and my Zyliss salad spinner.   I bought this particular model for my dad's birthday and both he and my mom love it. I have a similar version at home (clear, see-through) and my girlfriend's parents have an earthen-ware version at home. They all work great.  Once you try this, there's no way you're going to go back to the traditional butter dish 
Works great.  Bought for making candle tarts and it didn't let me down.  I would recommend this hot plate for any use 
These pans are great, they are very sturdy and good quality. don't buy anything else! trust me 
does anyone know of a good site where you can get a good deal on the bag liners for these great trash cans? 
i love the large size of these glasses. its great for swirling your wine. we had a large party and everyone commented on how elegant they looked and how much fun they were to drink from 
I've got a dog, cat and a small child- my floors have been a mess! I am so glad I bought this vaccuum- the suction is great and it picks up all the animal hair. Great price, too. I would highly reccomend this to anyone, especially people with pets- we emptied it 4 times just doing the living room the day we got it in the mail. Now my hubby vaccuums regulary- he loves it too 
I love it!  My kids and I had it open 10 minutes and ordered another one for my mom!! 
This is a handy, sturdy and attractive bottle opener you can use to either flip open pop-top caps or pierce the top of cans. Its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional bottle openers do, keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries, and rendering it perfect for broth cans, soda bottles, cans of baby formula, etc. Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its elegant, stylized, standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar. Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years, and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. After submitting this product to over two years of normal use, mine is still just like new. --Reviewed by Maritza Volma 
A great quality french press that made Bodum famous. Simple, easy to clean and quick! Ideal for the times when you need a nice cup of fresh brew coffee but couldn't find a coffee maker nearby.  
I have some nice nonstick cookware that I needed whisks for, so I got these. My main reasons for choosing them were the brand, and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone, rather than silicone coated steel. Unfortunately that is NOT the case. This is silicone coating metal. This is acceptable though, because the 5-year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off, and 5 years of cookware-safe whisking for this price is worth it to me! The whisk is wonderful, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Just don't believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above 
The spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove. The food does not fall through the slots. It is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying.  It is good for dipping out food out of dishes also. The only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when I received it. It didn't hurt the function of the spatula. It is a great tool to have in the kitchen 
I've seen this particular clock at other web sites.  I decided to buy it from Target.com because the price was good and there is free shipping.  When I received the clock in only 3 days, I was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I inserted an AA battery only to wonder whether I had gotten a "dud" -- it didn't make any perceptible tick.  Soon it was clear that the clock was working well and I hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and I love it.  I highly recommend this very quiet, well-made clock 
I live in SW Florida. Everything down here rusts, even the nails in the walls. I am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives, having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives. Amazon has a deal I couldn't refuse. $90 steak knives for only $29.99. I bought two sets and I couldn't be happier. It will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight, after using big clunky steakhouse-style wooden-handle knives for so many years. My husband might not be as enthusiastic as I am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well. I will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case. Some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp, but I don't keep my knives in boxes. No storage room. I have a lot of stainless steel German knives and I consider them to be the best. I have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there, handy and nice-looking. These will complete my collection of nice-looking knives on that wall, handy where I can just reach up and grab them. You just can't beat the price, but if you don't like them you can return them. Amazon is the best place I have found to buy everything I need for my kitchen, bar none. I will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures 
After mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time, this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf, with an interesting pattern on the crust.  My first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly.  It is  much easier than hand shaping a loaf, and much more rustic/natural than  using a loaf pan.  The natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the  old-fashioned way. When it's done rising, carefully remove it from the  basket and care fully put it on a pre-heated bread stone in the oven.  The  loaves look and taste great 
Nice compact size-can be moved easily. Does freshen the air in the room noticeably. On whisper setting is almost silent. On Turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life, maybe would sleeping. Does shoot out air but does not "blow" with any force. Over time, like a day, all the air in our 20'x20' living area changes. Did have a noticeable plastic like new odor  the first few days of use which wore off. Haven't had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks, but it would be easy to clean. 
This stainless steel stock pot is just right for those of us who can't fit our favorite soup recipes into a dutch oven. Cleaning it is a breeze, and it is still small enough to fit on a convenient cabinet shelf. That says it all 
I've cleaned my wedding rings and watches with it and am happy with its performance.  No, it does not clean as well as the ones at the jewelry store... nevertheless, it gets the "in-between" job done quite nicely 
Although it doesn't mention it, these HEPA replacement filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04150. I had to email Hamilton Beach to find out, but they were very helpful and responded right away. When the filters arrived from Amazon, I saw that on the box it says "Fits Models 04160, 04161 & 04150."    With our cat and houseful of antiques, we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around. I run this model in our office, under the table which holds the computer. Since placing it there I have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated. I placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job. The regular settings can be louder than expected, but I leave them on the "whisper quiet" setting when we're in that room and I don't even notice them being on. I would definitley recommend the Hamilton Beach air cleaners 
This bowl is very durable and I love the different colors that it comes in.  The bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times.  We basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream, popcorn, nachos, etc.  I love these bowls and am going to buy a set of Fiestaware for my mom 
Cast iron pans are the way to go. No dangerous non-stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them. This one is probably the best I have ever owned. Only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner. Bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges. But for pancakes, etc. this is perfect. Get this one and a smaller 10" pan and you'll have bases covered. 
We had an ancient Kitchen Aid and I loved it... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky.  Our daughter now has it and is happy with it.  We bought the Hamilton Beach mixer and I like it almost as much as the Kitchen Aid.  The best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up, making things a bit easier.  The only slight complaint I have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump... it's a little too fast for what I want, most of the time.  Another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter 
I bought these for Christmas presents for a few people - and they LOVED them!  They were an incredible deal, warm, and appropriately sized.  They were so great that now I want to go back to get some for myself.  Colors were great too 
Ove Glove is great -- everything they say it is.  My husband is the chef.  It was my Valentine's Day gift to him and he's happy as a clam!  Thanks, Ove Glove 
This product worked as well as expected and the vendor was easy to deal with.  The product shipped on time 
I've been using Spiegelau wine glasses for several years, and they are excellent. The bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine. These glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine. (They're also not bad for Rhones, though I prefer the Reidel Vinum syrah glass.)  If you drink a lot of burgundy, or pinot noir, or Italian Piedmont wines (barolo, barbaresco, langhe), I'd suggest Spiegelau's burgundy glass. If your preference is zinfandel or chianti, you're a bit out of luck with Spiegelau however. Their chianti glass isn't very good. Try the Riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines; you'll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet.  Some reviewers have complained about breakage. I've seldom broken a glass, but it does occasionally happen during washing. My method is to clear the sink, run the water as hot as possible, put a bit of dishsoap in each glass. I then use a special ultra soft brush (which I got at a local wine shop for about $6) to clean the glass, removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim. Then rinse thoroughly with very hot water. Invert on cloth. After about half an hour, with the glasses almost dry, you can wipe them off with paper towels (which don't leave any lint behind) and put them away.  The main thing is never to lay them down in the sink, and wash one glass at a time. Just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you're doing. Don't try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying; just use the paper towels.  Finally, even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe, I don't know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher. Dishwashers always leave a film, and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses, which lose their clarity as a consequence 
I like this grater. It's easy to use and clean. And, nothing is better on salad than freshly grated cheese 
These pans are light and clean up great just don't use metal in them. Will buy more 
I ordered the 45-piece place setting, it had to be the quickest turn around I have ever come across.  Ordered on a Thursday, had it on a Monday!  Everything was in perfect condition.  I am so pleased with Amazon and the way they do business.  I will buy from them again.   The dishes are beautiful, I couldn't be happier.  Thank you 
My three cats adore this playpen.  Just moments after putting it on the floor, they started playing with the tease.  They also love snuggling in the bed together (2 cats fit at a time).  My only complaint is that I can't find the replacement teases -- they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non-catnip styles.  The manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and I can't find them at Petco's online store.  I would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find
