58f714f6498e75a59a212429,I was really impressed by how quickly my claim was dealt with. I was treated as someone telling the truth!
58f714de498e9cf2b5105091,The claim process was very simple and straight forward with no obstacles or delays. Thank you. I would be happy to recommend AXA.
58f71431498e541e80a527de,Simply by ringing me about my policy instead of having a machine like interactive service online
58f711d0498e541e80a51fe5,all good
58f710be498e9cf2b510378f,Done via a comparison site. Easy enough to go through the questionaire, the only thing I ndidn't like was a) The continual charging every year subject to you accepting their quote (what happens if you don't get the quote and forget your insurance is due) although to be fair you can opt out of this after you have purchased the first one. b) Getting proof of no claims bonus. I have to get a written statement from my old provider and forward it to Axa. The last insurance provider is hardly going to put themselves out to supply that and as insurance companies can comunicate with each other via P.C I see no reason for me to prove NCD when the company should be able to do this. I might add that this is the first time that I've been asked to dom this and I change companies a few times. If it hadn't been for the 2 points above I would have given them 5 stars.
58f71082498e9cf2b51032cb,Simple easy to obtain. Very helpful staff.

58f70b01498e75a59a20ede4,Excellent service. Very prompt and efficient.
58f7043e498eeb8b91f59f02,Confusing interaction with the web site when I changed my address. Kept asking to me to pay the balance of.....Â£00.00.
58f700d6498eeb8b91f5669d,The four stars were for the signing-up process. Final judgment will be made at then of the year, OR, if I have to make a claim!
58f6fafa498e75a59a20a374,The process was quick and easy to renew my car insurance
58f6f984498e75a59a209fc5,Excellent service, I have several insurances with AXA and I have always found them very competitive.

58f683e8498e541e80a261b2,Luis Customer service was excellent, he really did explain everything very clear. He was very professional
58f6837a498e0e81e9ceed0f,Being able to speak to a person with knowledge of the products on offer and to explain the answers to detailed questions is better than being left floundering in a call handling system or using a website which does not contain the information sought. In this case the quotation for insuring my new car was very competitive and saved me from having to seek quotes from other providers.
58f68336498e541e80a25b50,The customer service executive was helpful, polite and efficient.

58f66b10498e75a59a1d4fc0,Answered the phone very quickly - although I had actually called the wrong department the customer service operative I spoke to was very helpful and put me through to the right place promptly. The sales team member who helped me with my purchase was equally polite and helpful. I used a comparison site to get my initial quote and was then put through to the AXA website from there - very clean and clear website, extremely simple to use and gave me an excellent policy covering all my insurance needs at a great price. All in all very happy customer.

58f650f1498e9cf2b50b8c18,Very quick to help and get the ball rolling after a minor collision I had last year. The repairs were of a high quality and the time taken had little impact on my day to day routine. All AXA staff (claim handlers) were good to speak to and dealt with any questions effectively. The only downside was there was no final explanation at the time as to who was at fault, ie, me or the third party, still not sure of the final decision and why.  Would I recommend AXA Insurance? Yes, they provide a good service.
58f6503c498e9cf2b50b7b9a,Very good service really pleased kept me well informed/updated via text and emails about my insurance. Good quote yet again on insurance. would recommend to family and friends.

58f61b57498e9cf2b507aae4,Convenient that I already have a policy with AXA and so got a discount adding another car which is always helpful AXA are always near the top with the most competitive quotes and would recommend people to give AXA a try when looking for car insurance especially if you have more than 1 car to insure.

58f60ef0498e541e809d7493,..
58f60ebc498e9cf2b5075af4,Very good initial call, asking relevant questions. made you feel relaxed to discuss the situation. Then the email correspondence was to the point, wanted additional information but were not pushy and gave options when providing evidence. Also settlement was agreed within a day of receiving the information and money transferred within 3 days. That was great
58f60da2498e75a59a18a45f,Couldn't be happy a very pleasant service and helpful and informative thanks ð
58f60b00498e75a59a1894a6,First time use but found the operators very helpful and polite.
58f60ae7498e75a59a189447,My named contact spoke to AXA on my behalf and was given the information i needed straight away. Then i upgraded my policy ,no problems and the new information was processed.
58f60933498e541e809d584a,Polite and helpful staff, gave lots of information and left me knowing what I was buying and at a reasonable price. When I received my email, it said change to insurance which was inaccurate as this is a new policy and I am having trouble accessing my documents as I don't have a password and there is no invite to create one.
58f60688498e541e809d4a1a,REALISE CAR INSURANCE GOES UP EVERY YEAR. HOWEVER ALWAYS GIVEN ADVANCE NOTICE WHEN RE INSURING CAR. GOT A GOOD INSTEAD OF EXCELLENT DUE TO INSURNACE GOING UP.
58f605e5498e9cf2b507289a,Great efficient service thank you
58f601a8498e9cf2b5070f29,Good. No issues (though I have never needed to make a claim) and competitive straightforward renewal too. Like the online site.
58f60136498e541e809d310e,They kept me in touch, letting me know when my insurance was due, plus the fact it was a very reasonable price, and it was very easy to renew
58f5fca6498e9cf2b506f5cf,I made a claim which the other party eventually admitted. I was not at fault, but it took nearly 2 years to get AXA to pursue the other party. In the meantime I have lost my no claims bonus despite the other party admitting liability and I can not switch provider without this claim being treated as my liability. In total I would have saved money burning my car and AXA with it.
58f5fc4d498e0e81e9a35452,Seemed to be a few technical errors this morning!
58f5fc38498e75a59a18437a,Easy to set up on line

58f5f498498e541e809cdd99,Very easy to renew
58f5f28e498e541e809cd23e,A very easy to understand and use electronic interface for my car insurance needs. Minimal premium increase this year too. Thankfully, no claims yet...
58f5f180498e75a59a17f385,Got clear reminder and price so able to make decision. Then it was very easy to book online with instant confirmation and promise only to charge my account on renewal date. This was done and it was simple to print new cleric ate of insurance. The website has clear graphics.
58f5ef79498e9cf2b506a166,Simplicity in renewing policy. Totally hassle free.
58f5ec38498e541e809c97a1,Very approachable on the telephone so that we reached a deal the suited both parties. Getting certificates etc off the web is straightforward.
58f5e830498e541e809c86f9,I used your company in switzerland and would recommend your company to my freinds.
58f5e7e2498e0e81e99fd585,Good service but not insured quick enough on data base
58f5e7be498e541e809c85a7,Easy to use web site, insurance at a competitive price.
58f5e6a4498e0e81e99fb8dd,Firstly you saved me from Admiral last year when they refused to let me renew early so that I would have a valid certificate to travel in Europe. Renewal with you was simple and the large expected increase in cost didn't materialise.
58f5e56b498e0e81e99f782f,Simple to get a quotation and I find the premiums are very competitive
58f5e489498e541e809c79bd,I made an error in my payment and they contacted me, very politely and helped me correct this. They were courteous and patient - I could not have had better treatment.
58f5e24a498e0e81e99eece1,Yes and you gave plenty of notice of renewal.
58f5e17b498e541e809c6f01,Excellent service, very competitive, would ,and have recommended to others, Thanks Mark.
58f5e069498e9cf2b506376d,the service was fast however i made changes to my policy for renewal online that werent translated to the policy when it was renewed. The changes I added online would have reduced my policy by about Â£30 however when i then tried to make these changes to my policy retrospectively it added Â£3 to the cost.
58f5e060498e75a59a179a12,Make it easier to open our account
58f5e03f498e75a59a17998c,Auto renew without enormous year-on-year increases (which is why I moved from DirectLine after many years)
58f5db10498e75a59a177c01,Notification of renewal well in advance. No problem adding temporary drivers to the insurance. Clear website - easy to use.
58f5d881498e0e81e99d4952,all made so easy and yes i would recommend to others
58f5d479498e75a59a1763a6,great service - I recommend Axa
58f5d2b1498e0e81e99cd027,The customer service was great and the person I spoke to showed great patience with me and making sure I understood all the options available to me.
58f5d0c1498e541e809c084a,Really good competitive price and easy to use system that explains everything clearly
58f5d01a498e0e81e99c5106,gave the best quote by far and good service on easy to use web site
58f5ce24498e541e809bfa5a,Ease of doing business
58f5ce06498e0e81e99c1e2f,Really professional and good.
58f5cdd4498e9cf2b505bc17,Car insurance companies. We all do the yearly dance. You receive an increased quote then have to phone to negotiate a lower one or move elsewhere. 'Congratulations sir, you have made no claims this year. As a reward we have decided to increase your premium as you are clearly a liability.' Why, oh why, has not one single company decided to break the mould and actually reward customer loyalty? I don't think I've ever stayed with the same company year on year. The first person who doesn't try to increase my quote will get my repeat custom. Axa are the same. My quote increased by Â£100 as a reward for another year of careful driving. I'm leaving them in a couple of weeks as I am selling the car.
58f5cc8d498e9cf2b505b6cd,Nothing to say.
58f5cc3f498e541e809be358,Competitive prices. Good communication. Clear procedures.
58f5cc1a498e0e81e99b9d3e,good policy which has a variety of useful cover eg bikes
58f5cb41498e9cf2b505acaa,I have been using AXA for a few years now and have had to make a claim during that time. I found them very helpful and my claim was dealt with in a very prompt and professional way. Would definitely recommend them.
58f5ca56498e75a59a172e4c,I found Axa through a cashback site and although they were not the cheapest I did find they offered the best value. The site is easy to use, quick and easy easy to personalise.it offered various packages and as I live in rented I found the majority of things I didn't need, however I did have a play and adding various things did not increase the premium greatly. The contract after (email) was instantaneous. Very good service.
58f5c8e5498e0e81e9997425,Reasonable rates, well timed reminder of renewal, automatic renewal works well.
58f5c88d498e9cf2b505a19c,When quoting a renewal price ensure that its the lowest.
58f5c73d498e0e81e9992cec,Quick and easy renewal process

58f5adac498e541e809b5dbb,Having been with Axa for a number of years I was very pleased when my renewal came through and by making one phone call the premium was reduced to match lower quotes given by other companies without any hassle.
58f5acf3498e541e809b5846,Haven't had any service yet. Just paid for a policy I took out myself via a comparison site.

58f5ab0c498e9cf2b5053181,I'm an existing customer and with the renewal of my insurance AXA have done credit check without notifying me that did affect my credit score. At least I deserve a notice as an existing client and so on....

58f57fbd498e75a59a164019,Online site so easy to use and so straight forward as well as receiving my registration documents for my insurance within minutes of purchase Always take stuff that works well for granted so thought I'd leave a review for once
58f56f1f498e9cf2b5047801,Yes
58f54a91498e75a59a158dbf,Car insurance is a legal requirement so AXA and others can charge what they like and get away with daylight robbery .NCD makes no difference or loyalty as the price keeps going up even though whiplash new rules should reduce them .Rip of Britain !
