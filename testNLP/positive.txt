My grandma's 10 year old Yorkie just would never shut up.  He barked at our cat, at our parrot, and anything that moved really.  We bought this collar, and it worked perfectly and immediately.  One bark and it sprayed, and he would go running off...and stop barking!  I felt kinda bad for him, but his reaction was hilarious.  I couldn't stop laughing at him, poor thing.  However, he did learn that if the collar wasn't on, he wasn't going to get sprayed, so he would bark

I am looking for a new book light, and as a former owner of this light, I was suprised at the bad bulb stats.  This bulb, like halogen bulbs, get very hot.  It is imperative that you do NOT touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it.  The oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp. and hastens failure.  Hope this help

I have a 3 1/2 year old Boxer that barks, cries, whines, and howls when I go to work...ALL DAY...I know, I recorded it.  I went to Petsmart and picked up this gadget.  Brought it home and it the manual correct button.  She bolted.  She hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes.  It reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and I don't crate my dog when I'm going to be away for more than 8 hours.

So if I'm just running out for a few hours I stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if I'm going to work I use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar.

My girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it.  Worth the price in my opinion.  Best advice is to take it home and try it.  Some dogs react to it.  Others don't

I found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate.  It's a soft light (almost seems like a natural spectrum) and is very directed at the page.  The clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover, and the neck is flexible as needed.  So, functionally, it gets a solid A.

But I wasn't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries (two of those round watch/calculator batteries).  Replacing them is a hassle (though inexpensive) because I have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before I leave, and I have to find them in a store with an electronic department.  I wish this light took AAA or something.

The light does include batteries, so you won't need to worry until you run out.  For me, that was  probably around 20 hours or so

I picked up a dozen in Home Depot for less than $5. Same concept, just a lot cheaper!

Two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen. The hole they make depends upon the weight of what they're holding. I'm sure it's pinhole sized if you're hanging something that weighs a few ounces (in which case, you don't need this - use a pushpin!)

The holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized, but it IS a heavy shelf. The hole is still WAY smaller than the hole I'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf.

It also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks (the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang.) This is a small detail, but if you need two of these things and you don't do it right, your object is gonna be crooked. But on the bright side, you won't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it!

Recommended product (but look around for the knockoffs.

After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats

The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl.

A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together). The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. It's the kind with the rotating hub (two hub sizes are included, one for lemons and a larger one for oranges, etc). While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black & Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying.

The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. At first I was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options, but after thinking about it, you only need the provided On, Off and Pulse.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it again from Amazon? Again, absolutely. The transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised

I have the black Fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room), and my wife and I already love this machine.  We have tried all sorts of mixes, and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do.  This is one of the first times I've been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it.

Physical properties: It handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray, which is largely unneeded anyway), and all our "standard" mugs.  The drink head moves up and down, so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with "frothy" drinks than coffee and tea).  When it brews a filterpack, it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and, thus, keep it from dripping as you remove it).  The water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long), but if you have a ready source of water nearby, it shouldn't be a problem.  The tank fits better and slides on easier than the Senseo (which we also have).

Flavor-wise: It's made by M&M/Mars, so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called Indulgence fare) is excellent.  Coffee blends are quite good, especially the darker roasts like "French Roast" and "Sumatra".  Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks, moreso than other chains.

Clean-up: Wipe the inside of the drink head, and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly "splashy" drinks.  No need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine, especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug.  Of course, you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low, so your first few times, you'll probably get a drip here and there.

Final bits: We've had the Senseo since its launch.  Between pods that need "pre-wetting" to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks, the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia.  We drink coffee, tea, espresso drinks, mixed blends, and sweet-tooth-friendly "indulgence" mixes every day with the Flavia, and it's brain-dead-easy to use.  Certainly easier to clean up after, too!  If you're on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings (like Senseo), get the Flavia.  Keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the Flavia.    I'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now, made over ice, and it's fantastic.  Highly recommended

For quite a while I had been looking for a certain type of DVD rack/tower...then one day in Target I was looking at the Mission collection and saw the box (no display). It is exactly what I had been looking for. Slapped on the two foot ends and done! Perfect fit for DVDs, 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy DVD cases, like the ones New Line Cinema puts out, you can fit more. I don't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one DVD per slot. I have many oversized ones. The hardwood is great too, just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall. If you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then...it is worth it. I am almost ready to buy a third one soon

We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners.  They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking.  We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet.  We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews.  I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America.  I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together.  We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack.  I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job.  Ok...our Hoover came.  My husband put it together and it leaked all over.  I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them.  By then we had already taken it to the repair center.  After a week they had not touched it.  My husband picked the machine up  and brought it home.  We decided to start from square one and put it together again.  He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!!  Yeah!  My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman.  So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first

Okay, I haven't used this while reading in bed yet...but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting, it's great! 

The light isn't good for areas that are adequately well-lit, so don't bother to use the light there. But in areas where light is dim, the light shines. Literally. It casts a bright light on the page(s) that you need to view. It's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading. 

Yes, it's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag. Imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go.  The power adapter, however, is a cumbersome brick. As for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for, I can't offer an estimate of time yet - but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so- cumulative, not consecutive hours. So, no complaints yet about that. 

Whenever I saw this light online or in the store, I used to think, "Why in the world would I ever want something like this?" Now, my thoughts are: "Why didn't I ever think to buy this before?

Like many people, I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such, they still have no concern for the noise pollution. I was losing sleep, and the barking was getting so bad that I even considered moving! 

In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money.

WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...?

It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately. It's as if it's afraid to bark. YAY!

You can select the volume, tone, and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say, from talking or loud bird squawking). Audible and inaudible both work fine, but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting.

The device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 D batteries (not included) to operate it. 

I am SO thankful we found Super Bark Stop! My nerves were really getting jangled and I was dreading early mornings, when they put the mutt outside. It's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean I want saddled with its noise while you neglect it!

P.S. After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer. The person I bought it from said that "once it's opened, we find that it's not 100% waterproof". Well guess what? You gotta open it to put the batteries in it! Either buy a faux bird house to protect Bark Stop or house it where it won't get wet. Otherwise, you may find yourself in the same position we were in. We got a refund, and fortunately for us, our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one

They really do work as advertised.  They go right into drywall (be careful not to hit a stud however!) with no muss and no fuss.  I haven't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds, but for basic home picture hanging, etc. they really do work as advertised

After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats

My golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old.  Over the years we have tried allergy shots, dietary changes, and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune.  We tried Zymox and it is absolutely fantastic.  Her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment.  The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear.  This stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges, I'm happy to keep it on hand

This is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone.

I am not in the habit of writing reviews, but this juicer earns it.

Perhaps you are like me, and have never used a juicer before. You want to get one without taking out a small loan, because you just don't know if your that into it. If so, this is your juicer.

There are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting. I just want to back those up with my experience. This is a good, strong product

This is a significant improvement over the 750 model. The 750 model was not very well designed. The first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. We returned this. We got the 760 to replace that. The 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. For the same price as the 750, the 760 comes with one extra bowl,  juicer and egg whisk. Compared with others like the Cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed.

I bought one of these for my girlfriend... THEN read the reviews! In my opinion it appears to work fairly well. The sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage. To the far left seems to work best for 'normal' walking. As I said, in terms of accuracy, I think it's pretty good. The radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5' stars. The sound is "tinny"; it's NOT stereo; there's NO frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size! Though overall, when comparing price to features... this little fella will probably suit your needs. If you already have a Walkman (or don't care about audio) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet

My 13-year-old cat was limping for a few days, off and on, and my vet said it was probably arthritis. A friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog Nutramax Cosequin had helped him, and I already knew that regular cosequin has helped ME with MY arthritis, so I bought a box of Nutramax Cosequin For Cats from my vet for my kitty to try. It really made a difference! He stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake. He was so happy, and so was I. On my vet's recommendation, I continued giving him one tuna-flavored capsule each day, sprinkled over his food, as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration, all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication. I would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis; and buying it from Amazon saved me about 2/3 of the cost from the vet.

I have used this vacuum only on carpet, as I bought it for my finished basement.  

Suction is very powerful, it is quiet, and the dirt cup is so easy to empty.  The cup is designed so that you push a lever, and it empties from the bottom - very clever and so easy and clean.  It is a large dirt cup so it holds a lot.

Other nice features include a very long cord, and great looks!  The most important thing is suction, and this baby is POWERFUL!!  It's amazing what this thing picks up.

Overall, extremely pleased with this vacuum!

My only complant is that the cord is shorter then I am used to. But I guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind. This feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly.

It sucks great, is easy to clean, and light weight. The price is fantastic

We bought our French skillet two years ago, and it has yet to even have one scratch on the cooking surface. It can go in the dishwasher, and although we usually hand wash it, it is nice to know that easy clean up is possible. It gets used in our house every day, and is very durable. I am planning on purchasing more for my family! We also have a covered pan and a six inch pan that we use almost as much. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed in this pan

None of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff! I bought this and the 8" fry pan 2 months ago and, except for the bottoms, still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day. I even used a bacon press (cast iron) in it every time I cooked bacon and a couple of times I accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left. Hubby stacked knives and forks inside, then topped it off with 6 dinner plates. I thought it was done for--scratches and nicks everywhere, but no, not a single mark. My Calphalon Commercial nonstick (which hit the trash already) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr. old did that. I must admit, though, that I do not use metal utensils in it, nor do I put in a dishwasher since I won't have one til the kitchen is remodeled. Overall, though, just from what abuse it has gotten, I'm very impressed and will buy more. My advice? Don't mess with the rest--buy the best and this is it. Going to try the wok next. Wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it

This is probably one of the best blade grinders out there.  The top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup, eliminating the scoop step.  It has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate, along with cup amounts.  The amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on, however.  Anyways, bottom line:  it grinds great with little mess.

My mother had a set of Franciscan Apple dinnerware as I was growing up, though I never thought too much about what I was eating off of at the time.  Later, as a wife and mother myself, I was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen.  We had just moved to Appleton, WI (16 years ago) so I decided to use an &quot;apple&quot; theme, w/o even connecting the idea with my mom's dishes.  I was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the Franciscan dishes. Over the years I've collected innumerable apple items, but my goal is to have a set of Franciscan apple dishes of my own!  They do chip, but they last forever and retain their color beautifully

This is an excellent product. If you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium, and making huge messes, walking in puddles, etc..and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks, this product is for you. Don't waste your money on cheap suction devices, and buy the python today! (sorry if I sound like an infomercial, I'm just an enthusiastic user). The python attaches to your faucet, you turn the water on full blast, stick the suction tube end into your tank, and you can drain your tank in minutes, or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes. Then, you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up (again, in minutes). I have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon, as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank, and what used to take me a whole day, now takes about an hour (to do all tanks). I like that I can vacuum the gravel, boy does this thing suck the waste up. This will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great! I was skeptical that this product would work, but am so glad that I bought it. Now I actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it. 

The directions are easy to follow~ even for people like me, who are "direction impaired."

I had a small version of salad shooter, it was great, used it for so many years, but now the blade was dull, and I kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them. I decided the next salad shooter I buy should be slightly larger. So I bought this salad shooter professional series, which is great, having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day: multiple cones to change, large feeding place for the veggy, fast, light, eassy to clean including in the dishwasher,still small enough to store in small spaces,efortless to cut and shread your veggy, no need for knife and cutting board.
What I like the most about this product is the fact that when I put veggy in it to be cut, shread..., the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut, so I do not have to push it in, probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades. This way your work is done in no time.
In my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen.

Admittedly, I am a bit of a knife-buying nut.  I love kitchen knives and own chef's knives and santuko knives from Wusthof, Henckels, Kyocera and Furi.
This Calphalon Katana 6-inch chef's knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance-wise.  I like the way the handle is shaped, it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious.  I love the way it looks too!  For the price, I'd say you can't go wrong.
I really like it a lot!  I have only had it for a few weeks though, but
it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we'll see how well it resharpens when the need arises.

I bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills, I thought this one seemed to have the better reviews, so I bought it.  I really love it. It heats up pretty quickly, and has enough space for 2-3 people 4 people would have to eat slower, but it does have enough broiler space, and its square to have people at all 4 sides.  We use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal.  The only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say.  Most of it comes off very easily, but some spots of cooked grease remain, it comes of with some elbow grease, and a scrubby, but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was

I bought this Espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk. It is great if you like to make lattes. Or just plain expressos. It brews fast, less than two minutes.  

It makes a great Cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like Pilon or Bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans.  I do not use Italian roast because I do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes.

Having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan, as the tittle says:  Pay the 3-4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead.  I'm using the preseasoned more because it is just ready.  

Keep in mind its large and heavy.  Careful in your sink.  Coming from stainless steel and converted over to Calphalon ( mostly bought all pieces from Amazon.com ), if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me.  

Heat kills everything.  If you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water / salt / scrubbing..  and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark, then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with.  But we all pay for convience and these pans I use mostly to sear meat.  With a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives, get the preseasoned.

Recently purchased this in mid-2006 and it is the best cookware item I have ever owned and used.  As one of those millions who rely on mid-line priced discount department store brands, I can state with 100% certainty I was amazed (and still am) with the high-performance this item offers!  The clean-up is still a dream-come-true, all I have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse, it practically cleans itself.  My burners are all equal size (gas stove) and highest setting is "6" I have learned all I have to do for pancakes is level 3!!  Cooking bacon, an entire pound, is no problem for this cookware.  I do want to purchase more of this item, there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available.  I'm even thinking of slowly switching to this brand "All-Clad" nonstick

I am a contractor and when I recently remodeled Doug and Susans basement I was eventually shown how to use the grinder to make espresso while on breaks.  Unfortunately, I started taking lots of breaks... good espresso!  The grinder is quiet, precise,and efficient, like an excellent sub contractor, or a good table saw!  The grinder was great.  I use a burr grinder at my house but you can't even talk over the thing.  This one whirs below a conversation level, then stores the suberbly consistant ground coffee.  I then pull the lever a couple times to dispense premeasured amounts into the doser that is resting in its holder on the machine, and there it is break is on!!  Thanks for the good times and good espresso.  On my way to hawk some of my tools to buy one of these things, it's worth it

After going through several Nathan's cheap stovetop grilles. I realized,that although I love grilling food, I needed a good grill pan. I did not wish upon a star but a dream came true with this marvelous cooking aid. I use it evry day, It NRVER sticks and the heat is so evenly distrubuted that everything comes out perfect! It also is a handsome addition to my kitchen.

This is my first "electric" litter box.  I have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up.  It really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box.  It was a breeze to set up.  I also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor. And with the tent they can't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a BM on the floor.  I'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down

I bought this sauce pan last week. The quality is very good. The handle design is quite comfortable. I tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan. I found no hot spot. It responded to the change in the heat setting is average. It's kind of heavier than All-Clad LTD for the same size of pan. I'm not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet. For the initial impression, this Calphalon One Non-stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as All-Clad - LTD, Stainless steel, MC2. Look for the bargain. It's worth the cost

This is a great cookie sheet. I chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum, and because I know it's durable. My mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago, and when I compared the two, mine was much heavier, and better quality. I would highly recommend this pan - especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and I was able to get 2 of these, along with 2 of the 9" round cake pans from  this company, for only $30! A great deal

This is a very nice piece of furniture.  Well built, good quality.  It was shipped via UPS and the box was quite damaged when it arrived.  Thank goodness for good packaging, or it would have been destroyed.  One of the doors did have a crack in it and a new door is to be shippped shortly.  A new mode of shipping should be considered.

I've already reviewed the Miele vacuum cleaner itself, along with the Turbo brush, so I'm a fan of the pricy-but-worth-it-if-you-can-afford-it sucker. If you're reading this, you're probably one too, so I'm not gonna talk about the vacuum cleaner on a net page selling the bags.  I'm just going to relate information on the box about what Miele vacuums this goes with, on the theory that's the main question you have. It's not entertaining, but perhaps it's useful:

S241 - S256 i
S290 - S291
S300 i - S399
S500 - S578
S700 - S758
S4000 - S4999

The box comes with 5 bags (they;re strong, I've discovered), 1 dust compartment filter, and one "super air clean filter."  Miele uses a HEPA filter, known for its allegy protection. Long-lasting, worth it

We bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand, that after 2+ years was no longer bouncing back into shape.  This Serta topper is just fine, as comfortable as our last one.  My big complaint is that someone at Serta (though Serta isn't the actual manufacturer) needs to measure a queen sized bed, because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides.  If you place the topper in the included protective cover, it's several inches short on all 4 sides.  I know 1 inch sounds minor, but if you're a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed, the topper doesn't protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress.  As far as toppers in general, we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed.  You don't feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper (though presumably with a full Tempur bed isolates even more).  Definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford, and the thickest you can afford

I bought this as a Christmas present for a dear friend of mine who recently began collecting rooster objects.

The entire set arrived in perfect condition.  The colors, red & black are vibrant and striking..the rooster pattern is on each piece and is very nice.    

Very good quality, good size and good price...will make a perfect holiday gift for serving pasta or stew or salad or whatever

I've used this for Indian food and it worked really well - you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala.

BTW I own other Anolon Advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup.

Re: the squishy handle. If you have gripping problems, as many middle age to older cooks do, this helps you.  Don't listen to the young, self-involved, and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature.  Some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature

This is, hands-down, the best hair removal tool on the market. It grabs an astounding amount of undercoat and topcoat hair. Just one usage of it on my dog cut his shedding by at least 75%. Regarding the complaints: Yes, hair will go all over the place, but that's stated in the instructions; use it in an area where you can sweep or vacuum

It really does make a difference when some of the chlorine is filtered out of your coffee (and even more so in your bourbon) water, but these filters are a rip off price-wise.  It's hard to believe Braun wouldn't make money selling them at a third of the price

It is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels:-)
What you probably don't see on the picture well, it stands on plastic, so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding. Has really easy refill-no mess, no fuss, and you can always see when you need to buy pepper. I don't think there is better pepper grinder out there. Others I saw are certainly better looking, artsy, whatever, but this one is the most useful!

These bowls are a perfect size for holding one portion.  Much better than plastic containers that melt in the microwave.  I use one almost every day for taking  my lunch to work.  At $2.99 it more than pays for itself every time you use it (verses buying a take out lunch).

I went on a hunt for these glasses for a friend after our having beverages in them in a (now gone) bar in NYC.  I was delighted to finally find the exact glass at, what I think is, an affordable price for the quality.  I bought a set and we ended up "splitting" them (he only wanted/had space for 4 - he lives in a small! apartment). I love them so much I've now put them on my wishlist.  The beautiful clear glass, clean design and impressive heft makes them feel elegant, special and expensive.  I'm *certain* the shape and feel make the single-malt scotch I prefer taste even better!  An excellent value at less than $40 for six

There's nothing worse than having to find space for, and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it. Henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop, and because she's on the countertop, you will use her. She works great. Will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling. I tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs, but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me. She poaches four eggs perfectly, and here, you can use jumbos if you like. The water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her, if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done, adding more or less water the next time will take care of that. Actually, the first time I poached jumbos, I found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste; I added a bit more water to the cooker, plugged her back in, and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute. When the water evaporates, she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing (as I am). I love this cooker. First one I have ever owned. And because she looks cute sitting on the counter, I don't forget I have her; therefore, she gets used alot

Have owned the Jura Capresso E8 since July of 2006. Have made over 750 coffees since that day. Heavy entertaining and daily latte's bring value to the machine. 
Machine has responded well under all circumstances. Only problem thus far has been with the frother which would jam from the froth to steam position.  Contacted Capresso and the expressed a new attachment. Have had no additional issues with machine thus far. 

Excellent crema  and good temperature for espresso. ( Warm the expresso cups before hand )

As with other machines I have owned, experimentation with coffee to milk ratio takes some time. Once determined the machine makes a consistent brew each time. 

Have run cleaning cycles and filter changes when prompted. Machine really is super-automatic. The machine informs you when water is needed, when beans need to be filled and when grounds need to be emptied. 

Would recommend the machine without hesitation. Should this change I will update the review.

I bought this glass for my wife (who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine) as a Christmas gift.  Last night, she tried out the glass with a friend.  The reviews from both of them were quite something to watch.  The wine from this glass tasted far, far superior to the same wine from an "ordinary" red wine glass.  In fact, they poured the remaining wine from the "ordinary" glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening.  There was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different, superior one

I bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning, and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day. This is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves. Some of the Honeycombs get a little crushed, but I've found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them. Reese's Puffs and Cheerios also came out without any crushing. You have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh. Maybe this was in the directions, but I missed it and learned the hard way. But the kids figured out the caps easily and it's not a big deal for them

I've been a chef for almost 15 years, and a knife is one of the tools I reach out most of the time.  During those years I've used all kinds of brands including Kershaw, Wusthof, Mundial and even Smart and Final brand.  And to be more specific, an 8 inch chef's knife is my favorite.  After having fun with these toys, I thought it's time to reward myself with an ultimate gift. So I sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive.  One day I came across the Shun Classic on the Amazon Web.
This knife sets itself apart from the others: the simplicity in design, the beauty of the blade, the sharpness, and finally its steel quality.  The blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from  layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a Samurai's Sword, WOW!  The D shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood, it fits in my hand nicely.  But the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness.  I can slice pieces of lemons micro thin!  It's not only super sharp, but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels I experienced with.  It weighs a little heavier, but I'm sure that's not a big deal for me. Cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there isn't any corner which will accumulate grease. 
Shun 8 inch Classic is the best I've ever had.  You won't regret what you pay for even though the price is very high.  A good chef deserves a good steel.

I bought this for my husband's birthday b/c I watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there. Carafes that leak, coffeemakers that don't keep the right temperature, etc...

This is the kind of coffee you get at a 5-star restaurant. In fact, they  probably use a Bunn.

The design is utilitarian-not decoration, and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee

The grill is a significant improvement over my previous Weber in regards to:
-grill area
-regidity of the cast iron grill
-control for raising or lowering goals
-large charcoal shelf
-three compartments within the charcoal shelf
-heavy guage metal construction
-the option of adding a rotisserie
The grill is wanting in regards to:
-lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill
-lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals

These cup are enormous! (Not to mention beautiful, in that fun and elegant way that only Fiestaware can be.) I was looking for a very large, oversized mug because I drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly. I definately got my wish. I have eaten soup and cereal out of these, I even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently. Very cute! I plan on getting them in all of the six colors I have in Fiestaware. Let me tell you again, this cup is HUGE

I odered this item as housewarming gift, the box has open display of 5 piece hostess set and 5 piece place settings, you can see and touch without open the box!
they are beautiful chess design.
some people doesn't care flatware  using the right way and after write negative review.
following this recomendations will result in the enjoyment of your J.A Henckels flatware for many years;
1. DO NOT ALLOW ACIDIC FOODS TO REMAIN IN CONTACT AFTER USE such as mustard, ketchup. lemon. etc  rinse all flatware that have been in contact with the above foods before placing in the dishwasher.

2, do not use detergents containing chlorides or a high lemon content.

3. do not soak for extended periods of time with tap water in the sink get rusting or spots.

4. in the dishwasher use a drying cycle.

100% RECOMMENDED !

After reading the other reviews, I almost reconsidered my purchase.  However, the juicer works great - as long as you follow a few tips.

1) Make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on TIGHT!  Check once, then check again.
2) Don't use the paper filters, particularly if you are juicing in quantity.  Once I threw mine in the trash, the balancing issues went away immediately.  It makes clean up a little harder, but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use, it's not a big deal.
3) If the item being juiced won't go through, be patient, and pulse-push it in.  Don't cram it with the pusher.

My only concern is that when you juice quantities, so much pulp sticks to the side it's hard for all of the juice out to strain out.  It's best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice.

Using the above tips - I expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time

We have tried a variety of knife sharpeners and they didn't work very well. Finally, I purchased this item and we have been quite pleased ever since. Friends even ask to use it.  If you need sharp knives for cooking then this item is a great purchase. The cost may seem higher than most but well worth the quality and it really sharpens both serrated and straight knives.  Easy to use and nice addition to a kitchen where you enjoy cooking.

We were very skeptical.  One of our cats would mark certain spots (like corners) occassionaly.  But we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room! It got so bad that we had to discard the rug.  We tried Boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day, but the one time we forgot to spray, he would mark again.  We were at our wits end and decided to try Feliway.  We bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots.  At first we also used the Boundary, but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn't see any urine markings anymore.  It took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work.  Our cat even appears more calm and pleasant.  We make sure that we replace the container of Feliway every 5 weeks or so.  It's well worth the money

Pros: I have two Chocolate Labs, therefore, I have a lot of hair to deal with.  The vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt (wood floors).  It works alright on rugs.

Cons: Not cheap. Loud. The plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you can't carry it, you just have to roll it instead. Not a big deal

These pans are made by Ekco and durable.  The nice thing is they do not brown the edges like the tephlon coated ones.  Just be sure to use wax paper on the bottom and they will come out with ease

I took a chance on ordering these, and I'm glad I did.  They are heavy-duty!  I like the handles as I do a lot of microwave cooking and it's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware.  I've also used these in a convection oven, and them seem to work really great!  I picked the "Sapphire" color, and they are very attractive on the table as well!

We recently moved, and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment.  One cat, usually friendly and playful, would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment.  The other cat, usually very docile, was being overly aggressive during "play time" with the other cat and with us.

After buying the Comfort Zone plug-in, we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week.  Both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal - more friendly and playful, less anxious and aggressive.

The only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug-in vial will last 4 weeks, but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3.  But maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left.  It is hard to judge when the plug-in actually ran out because the cats' behavior did not change, even after I unplugged the diffuser

Having used Hoover products in a commercial environment for many years I have had great service from them, providing many years of dependable and powerful operation.  We were excited to try out this "new" Hoover model.  One of the first things I have noticed about it over the previous Windtunnel Model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum.  This may bother some, but I see it as a testament to it's improved build quality over the Gen.1 Windtunnel.  This machine is very powerful and it's dual turbine motor has a confident sound.  I'll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is.  It is a nice feature though. I'll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is.

**UPDATE**

After having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences...

Two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 

1) Lacks a bag full indicator.  The bag filled on this machine, and then busted (unknowlingly) at the top around the bag collar.  "Stuff" went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter.  It took another vacuum to clean the mess up.  In the future I will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle, indicating how full the bag is getting.

2)  The cord rewinder is a nice feature, but truly lacks quality.  It will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance.  A stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference.

3)  Dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head, not that it presents a problem, but it's unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust.

Beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns.

I do most of the vacuuming. My wife's only request when I went looking for a new model was that it use a bag. She absolutely hates the bagless models and doesn't want to see what we're pulling up. We have two dogs (an Akita and a Golden Retriever) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day. So after searching I find this model. I researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me I take the plunge and order it from Amazon. Now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and I was shocked when it arrived in 4. The big thing I like about this unit is that the bags it uses (although a little hard to find)have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt. The unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well. And boy does it clean! Our rugs look fantastic!
One complaint I have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off. Another would be that you cannot turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position..I know its a safety feature..I just don't like it. The pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades. The little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas. 
Overall I would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from Amazon was so positive that I've purchased other items and make it my first place to look now

 I received the 10 pc set from my husband for Christmas.  I have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use. Some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans. Maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them. The pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly. I feel we made a good choice

It was a Christmas gift, truly enjoyed by my grandson who loves to cook (with supervision).  It's easy to store, and able to keep the oil in its container for several uses.  Bigger than the GranDaddy so you can cook more at one time.  It's great.  Have one myself and it has been with us for years.

I bought this when my air popper died & I am so glad I found this product!  The popcorn is the best & it is very simple to make.  The thing I like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn.  I can choose which oil to use & how much so I have total control over what goes into my popcorn so I feel confident that what I am eating is good for me.  

The packaged corn that came with was ok & a good introduction to using the popper but I will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own.  I did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book & it was fantastic!

I would recommend this to anyone, the popper is easy to handle, easy to clean & it makes the best, crisp & crunchy popcorn ever.  It only takes about 3 minutes to be done & you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings.  Sometimes simple & old fashioned is better & that is the case with this item.

Now we can't wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night!

Due to the slits around the opening, this label will fit a wide variety of neck sizes including Burgundy and those odd Rosemount Shiraz necks.  I would like it better if it were more of a plastic coated paper since I think it would hold up longer in a cellar, but at least it fits all my bottles.  The others I've purchased don't

I bought these for a wonderful craft.  I was expecting them to be decent, but I did not expect them to be as nice as they were.  If I realized how nice they were, then I would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping.  I realize that I got 100 bags, but my craft took about 75 of them.  They are nicer than the piping/icing bags that I used while I was learning cake decorating.  When these are gone, I will definitely order more. The plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out.

Great honing steel that is a bit longer than others I looked at (seems to help a bit for the bigger knives) and an attractive taper (not sure that matters, but it looks nice).  I've only had it a brief time, though I've used it frequently.  Despite an occasional clumsy collision, this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks.  It straightens the edge on my (mostly) mid-grade knives with ease.

Another reviewer claimed the handle was plastic.  Perhaps he was mistaken, or perhaps he had a different version.  But mine, purchased later, has a visible grain if you look close, under a dark ebony finish.  It does almost "feel" plastic due to the hard resin finish, but it is the same material as on the Shun knives a friend has (though the steel lacks the metal endcap that her knives have).

Aesthetics are open to debate, but I think it looks much nicer than most, and performs better than any other I've used for daily straightening.  For less frequent light sharpening, I recommend a diamond steel.  Global makes the best diamond steel I've seen, but I've stuck with the DMT for a quarter the price

This knife along w/the matching 7" 5-star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb, prime rib, ham, veal, turkey, etc...at various carving stations at my job. I love the 5-star line & have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife. I'd recomend trying the 4-star & pro-s line out as well before deciding on this line(same blades, different handles). I'd definately replace if lost/stolen. After using proper tools there's no way you can go back to cheap knives. I'd love to see a 12" version of this knife w/a wider blade

I have two kittens which are spoiled rotten and have more toys than they can ever wish for.  This is by far one of their favorites.  They love the moving ball and use the center scratch area often (keeps them off the furniture and other areas.) I know they play with it daily.  Very reasonably priced and definitely a must for cats!!

My husband received a similar bag for Christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer.  We are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine.  The black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we don't have to worry about the bottom falling out.  The material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well

This DeLonghi BAR32 Espresso Maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that I can find that does not have aluminum its water/coffee path.  The boiler, porta-filter & baskets, brew group, and steam wand are all stainless steel (albeit the wand has a plastic tip).  

I thought the Capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler  might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta-filter itself is made of aluminum (although it does have stainless basket inserts) and is TWICE THE PRICE than the Delonghi BAR32. It is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta-filter after exiting the stainless baskets - although Capresso implies no in their Ads.

I reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake.  The 5 quart + was worth the money, don't buy the 4 qt, save the money and purchase the 5, you'll be glad that you did

This is probably my favorite mug. It easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup. It comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim. The best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over. Even hard corners don't seem to phase it. It's also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat's efforts to tip it over. 

The odd shape also has downsides though. It won't fit in any cup holder I've ever come across, but that doesn't matter much since it won't tip over no matter where you set it. If you don't rinse it out immediately, it can be difficult to clean later, due to the shape; if you don't have small hands, you may need a bottle cleaning brush. Also, I imagine if you had more than one of these mugs, they'd be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space. Despite this, it's still a great mug. In fact I'm going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too

I was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting. I found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try.  It does a perfect job! I owned the original model when it first came out years ago. This one is more streamlined and improved.  The Dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups.

This bread slicer is quite good.  It has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it.  It cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized Loaves.  I have found though, that if I bake the largest size loaf, the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after I slice a few slices I am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container.

I am potty training my son, so I needed a good waterproof mattress pad but didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This fits the bill.  It's lightweight but sturdy, and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress, and held up well in the wash so far.  Has a nice feel, and it doesn't seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do.  Our mattress is old and thin by today's standards, but the pad seems roomy enough that I think if we got a new thick mattress, it would still work.  Very pleased with this purchase

This is essentially the All-Clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles.  The "dutch oven" sold by All-Clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1/2 quart saucier.

This is a versatile stovetop pan--wide enough for frying, deep enough for liquids, good-looking enough to carry to the table.  It can also slide into the oven when needed.  

It may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet, with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans, as one poster complained, but it functions quite well as an "everyday pan" for up to 4 persons.  The dimensions of 9 1/2 inches by 3 inches (plus handles) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape, with a rounded bottom for easy stirring.

If you are looking for a versatile "do-it-all" pan, this is a good choice

I searched for months for a stylish, durable set of flatware at a bargain price, and this is it!  I was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a Friday sale.  The design is unique and contemporary, and the finish and weight are of excellent quality.  The only criticism that I have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons - the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher.  However, this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous, inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come.

We purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago.  It has held up so well, that I just purchased ten more place settings (the Friday only sale) to use for entertaining.  Our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day.  This flatware is heavy and really nice to hold, (the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from).  The super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions.

Have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers, London broil, steaks.  It produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use.  The cooking grate can only be set at two levels: standing on its posts or inverted, lying on the rim of the firebox.  The level must be chosen before you start cooking, which presents a problem for some preparations.  The damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature.  Emptying ash is a bit awkward, as you need to remove the doors and coal grate, then lift and tip the firebox, which is heavy.  The lip catches some ash, so it is difficult to completely empty.  Be sure to set the grill on a pan, as grease will leak through and collect around the legs

I see a lot of people have leaky shakers.  Not me.  Mine is absolutely perfect.  The top/strainer piece fits snugly, leak-free, requiring just the right amount of effort to de-couple it from the canister.  The design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister.  The lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top.  The cap/jigger also fits perfectly, with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily

I have no kitchen stove so I have been relying on this little champ for everything from tea to pasta (before South Beach Diet) to making eggs in the morning, etc. I have owned this unit for over 3 years and have NEVER ONCE had a problem with it. Awesome for a college student or a person with a tiny apartment such as mine. Also great for taking to work. It is a bit hard to clean and there is not too much area to touch to move it while it is still cooling down. Other than that, I highly recommend it. I am here today to buy the DOUBLE version and I can only hope that it performs as well as it's little sister. Enjoy!!! - Li

I use this mug a lot for chicken noodle and other soups as well as salads.  Its easy to clean up and to handle.  I like having the lid with the pop top so its doesn't make a mess in the microwave.  I fits easily in the tote bag when commuting to work.  I highly recommend it!!

After much research and consideration I decided to buy this product as a Christmas gift for my husband.  I am not the type of person to research products before I buy them, but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso (and being Cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth--makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines), I did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations. I have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it.  My main concern was how HOT the coffee would be, and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee.  I've read reviews about the noise it makes, and after having the Deloghi product, the noise this machine makes when warming up is NOT that loud at all.  We are very happy with it.  Buy it, you'll be happy too

I have two of these, one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color.  They're attractive, of course; this is Fiestaware, after all.  But they're darn functional.  They're long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs, and they're deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you're carrying or serving.  I like wish there was one slightly bigger too; then I'd get two more

This product is great to have on hand. In the past, I've used purchased yogurt as a starter, but this eliminates the need to run to the grocery store when you want to make yogurt. After a small delivery snafu, the company immediately sent me a replacement. They also sent me a follow up e-mail just to make sure that I received the product (thanks Fred!!!

Love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh.  This one holds a larger amount than others I have had.  It is a bit more awkward to hold, however.  It has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up. Love the Emile Henry colors

Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated.  Nice furniture and practical book shelves.  But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around.  It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying.  But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water.

Not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter, but I previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home. This cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust. It is really useful on those thick pizzas, like spinach and feta. Plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board. I almost never use it for any non-pizza cooking, and a heavy, sharp knife works almost as well. However, it's a fun item, and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza, I definitely recommend it

Absolutely FAB!!! Shiny-bright stainless steel, matches Frieling French Press, and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly! Just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so...of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers. Overall these are just VERY sturdy/solid, clean-up beautifully and very easily, and, by the way, the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar, and sets inside the little 'notched' area of the lower bowl, so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple, yet European-engineered, well-thought out design & quality. I fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down...although it's a l-o-o-o-ng time until I'll be distributing my assets! Make sure to buy the matching Frieling French Press- it's just incredible, & also heirloom quality! Give yourself the gift of European quality coffeeware- it's one of life's simple, yet indispensible indulgences!  PS the Frieling French Coffee Press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too

How did this technology elude me for so many years? After spending decades of trying to "bring the butter up to room temp" by, variously, taking it out hours before I needed to use it, placing it on the warm radiator, zapping it in the microwave, or putting it in a dish of hot water, finally I've found a way to keep the butter spreadable and fresh!

Few kitchen aids are as useful as this one. I would rank this up there in the top-ten list along with my 8" Wusthof blade, 3" Chinatown-special drain mesh, Pyrex measuring cup, and my Zyliss salad spinner. 

I bought this particular model for my dad's birthday and both he and my mom love it. I have a similar version at home (clear, see-through) and my girlfriend's parents have an earthen-ware version at home. They all work great.

Once you try this, there's no way you're going to go back to the traditional butter dish

I've got a dog, cat and a small child- my floors have been a mess! I am so glad I bought this vaccuum- the suction is great and it picks up all the animal hair. Great price, too. I would highly reccomend this to anyone, especially people with pets- we emptied it 4 times just doing the living room the day we got it in the mail. Now my hubby vaccuums regulary- he loves it too

This is a handy, sturdy and attractive bottle opener you can use to either flip open pop-top caps or pierce the top of cans. Its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional bottle openers do, keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries, and rendering it perfect for broth cans, soda bottles, cans of baby formula, etc.
Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its elegant, stylized, standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar.
Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years, and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.
After submitting this product to over two years of normal use, mine is still just like new.

I have some nice nonstick cookware that I needed whisks for, so I got these. My main reasons for choosing them were the brand, and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone, rather than silicone coated steel. Unfortunately that is NOT the case. This is silicone coating metal. This is acceptable though, because the 5-year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off, and 5 years of cookware-safe whisking for this price is worth it to me! The whisk is wonderful, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Just don't believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above

The spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove. The food does not fall through the slots. It is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying.  It is good for dipping out food out of dishes also. The only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when I received it. It didn't hurt the function of the spatula. It is a great tool to have in the kitchen

I've seen this particular clock at other web sites.  I decided to buy it from Target.com because the price was good and there is free shipping.  When I received the clock in only 3 days, I was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I inserted an AA battery only to wonder whether I had gotten a "dud" -- it didn't make any perceptible tick.  Soon it was clear that the clock was working well and I hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and I love it.  I highly recommend this very quiet, well-made clock

I live in SW Florida. Everything down here rusts, even the nails in the walls. I am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives, having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives. Amazon has a deal I couldn't refuse. $90 steak knives for only $29.99. I bought two sets and I couldn't be happier. It will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight, after using big clunky steakhouse-style wooden-handle knives for so many years. My husband might not be as enthusiastic as I am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well. I will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case. Some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp, but I don't keep my knives in boxes. No storage room. I have a lot of stainless steel German knives and I consider them to be the best. I have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there, handy and nice-looking. These will complete my collection of nice-looking knives on that wall, handy where I can just reach up and grab them. You just can't beat the price, but if you don't like them you can return them. Amazon is the best place I have found to buy everything I need for my kitchen, bar none. I will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures

After mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time, this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf, with an interesting pattern on the crust.  My first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly.  It is  much easier than hand shaping a loaf, and much more rustic/natural than  using a loaf pan.  The natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the  old-fashioned way. When it's done rising, carefully remove it from the  basket and care fully put it on a pre-heated bread stone in the oven.  The  loaves look and taste great

Nice compact size-can be moved easily. Does freshen the air in the room noticeably. On whisper setting is almost silent. On Turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life, maybe would sleeping. Does shoot out air but does not "blow" with any force. Over time, like a day, all the air in our 20'x20' living area changes. Did have a noticeable plastic like new odor  the first few days of use which wore off. Haven't had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks, but it would be easy to clean.

Although it doesn't mention it, these HEPA replacement filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04150. I had to email Hamilton Beach to find out, but they were very helpful and responded right away. When the filters arrived from Amazon, I saw that on the box it says "Fits Models 04160, 04161 & 04150."  

With our cat and houseful of antiques, we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around. I run this model in our office, under the table which holds the computer. Since placing it there I have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated. I placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job. The regular settings can be louder than expected, but I leave them on the "whisper quiet" setting when we're in that room and I don't even notice them being on. I would definitley recommend the Hamilton Beach air cleaners

Cast iron pans are the way to go. No dangerous non-stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them. This one is probably the best I have ever owned. Only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner. Bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges. But for pancakes, etc. this is perfect. Get this one and a smaller 10" pan and you'll have bases covered.

We had an ancient Kitchen Aid and I loved it... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky.  Our daughter now has it and is happy with it.  We bought the Hamilton Beach mixer and I like it almost as much as the Kitchen Aid.  The best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up, making things a bit easier.  The only slight complaint I have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump... it's a little too fast for what I want, most of the time.  Another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter

I've been using Spiegelau wine glasses for several years, and they are excellent. The bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine. These glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine. (They're also not bad for Rhones, though I prefer the Reidel Vinum syrah glass.)

If you drink a lot of burgundy, or pinot noir, or Italian Piedmont wines (barolo, barbaresco, langhe), I'd suggest Spiegelau's burgundy glass. If your preference is zinfandel or chianti, you're a bit out of luck with Spiegelau however. Their chianti glass isn't very good. Try the Riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines; you'll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet.

Some reviewers have complained about breakage. I've seldom broken a glass, but it does occasionally happen during washing. My method is to clear the sink, run the water as hot as possible, put a bit of dishsoap in each glass. I then use a special ultra soft brush (which I got at a local wine shop for about $6) to clean the glass, removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim. Then rinse thoroughly with very hot water. Invert on cloth. After about half an hour, with the glasses almost dry, you can wipe them off with paper towels (which don't leave any lint behind) and put them away.

The main thing is never to lay them down in the sink, and wash one glass at a time. Just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you're doing. Don't try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying; just use the paper towels.

Finally, even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe, I don't know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher. Dishwashers always leave a film, and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses, which lose their clarity as a consequence

I ordered the 45-piece place setting, it had to be the quickest turn around I have ever come across.  Ordered on a Thursday, had it on a Monday!  Everything was in perfect condition.  I am so pleased with Amazon and the way they do business.  I will buy from them again.  
The dishes are beautiful, I couldn't be happier.  Thank you

My three cats adore this playpen.  Just moments after putting it on the floor, they started playing with the tease.  They also love snuggling in the bed together (2 cats fit at a time).  My only complaint is that I can't find the replacement teases -- they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non-catnip styles.  The manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and I can't find them at Petco's online store.  I would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find

I just got this waffle maker and have already made a perfect batch of honey wheat blueberry waffles.  I can't believe how easy it was AND how fat and fluffy they came out.  
I used Krusteez Mix, because I was out of eggs, and used frozen blueberries. The Mix told me to add a little oil for waffles. 
The booklet told me to plug it in and wait for the green light.  I sprayed it with pam.  I poured in 1/2 cup of the mix on each side, added blueberries to the top, closed it, flipped it, and that was it. The booklet says they are done when the steam stops.  They were brown before the steam stopped, so I pulled them out.  No sticking, no spills.
I almost purchased an $80.00 model, but decided to get this one after seeing all of the reviews.  What a great deal

This knife is great for hard cheeses, I can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces.  It feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other Global knife.  The blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily, but if you only use it for cheese, it should stay sharp for a long time.  This is another beautiful Global knife

We have some pretty nasty water from the tap, but this PUR filter system makes it taste so good.  I like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once.  The hand held ones I've used hold about 3.  I don't know how pure the water is, but it sure tastes great.

I have been using this cushion for a couple of years now.  I use to be able to buy it at Walgreens but they no longer carry it.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon.  I have several of the cushions around.  I keep one in my car, one at home, one at work, and now I have one to travel with.  I take it on airplanes when I travel.  I have broken my tailbone twice and the shape of the cushion takes pressure off of the tailbone.  I have recommended it to relatives and friends and they all pruchased it and love it

After cutting veggies, fish, meats, and fruit, this knife continues to be extremely sharp, well balanced, and easy to use.  What a great gift

i bought one of these for my apartment, and it's quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills.  it does contain the odor better than a garbage can, but does not completely eliminate it.  the instructions seem a bit confusing at first, but it's a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show.  with that in mind, it's a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor (particularly for indoor environments) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty's respiratory system

This Lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole. It is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees, so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole/soup tureen.  Handles are sturdy, but short, so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder, but easy to grip with bare hands. Because of this feature, you may decide to use this as a serving dish only. Good for a large group rather than due to large capacity. We are a family of 2, so we would prefer a smaller casserole from Lenox

I've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty, gloppy mess I throw in it, including shortening, butter, cream cheese, sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine. I spend less time cleaning up then I would have with glass as more is pushed out. I haven't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version. They both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are

Unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome; distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time.  With normal bread in before lowering, the bread sticks almost 1/2 way out of the toaster, making it very easy to remove hot toast, to toast smaller items (the plunger will go up even further to assist);  the slots are extra wide so, although I have not used the sandwich cage accessory, I can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage (apparently a British idea, and  maybe something worth investigating).  I am doing normal toast on only setting 2, bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect! (bagel feature: push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right).  The machine feels solid as if it will last a long time.  The Cobalt Blue color is more of a bluish-purple in normal light, but very attractive.
Very happy with the machine (the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping!

After reading reviews on the wok's available on Amazon[.com], I decided on this Wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher.  Turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher, but it is very easy to hand clean.   The non-stick surface has lasted, but I am careful to only use plasic or wood, and I wash it with a cloth and soap.  It gets to temperature quickly during cooking, the only 'complaint' I have is the simmer cycles (not a constant heat, but on and off).  I purchased some Thai cook books, (Real Thai, and Thailand The Beautiful Cook Book) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a Wok, how easy it is to prepare my favorite food.  The difference the wok made- I was able to cook at the correct temperatures.  My stove BTU is apparently quite low, it took forever to 'sizzle' so the food turned to mush before it was cooked.  I now use the wok for anything I want to cook fast and/or warm up

Great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice!!!
  You have to spray the pan really, really well with cooking
 spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the
 cornbread to come out in one piece.  I run a little spatula
 around the edges before I dump the pan.  Gave one as a gift
 at Christmas and it was a hit!!!

Just put a little hot water in the base, let sit for a few minutes and it pours out great!  So easy that even my little kids can use it without making too much mess

Glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter-point to Reidel.  Anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable

Yes, it is made to be a decanter for half bottles, but yes it does easily hold a full bottle.  What I use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner.  So, I decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses, and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed.  If you use it in the same manner, you do not have to worry about the size (but again, it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact).  I also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table, and guests love it

I bought these sheets 6-8 months back. I have been using these sheets regularly. Even after many wash I don't see the sign of lint coming out. This seems to be one of my great value for money.

  . Very soft and cozy.
  . Excellent for winter.
  . Even after many wash there are no sign of lints
  . Excellent for the price

If you want the retro look and a super toaster.....this is the one for you. Toasts perfectly and looks great! I've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever. Make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering.....it's a big toaster. Shape is unusual (taller in back than the front)which gives it a little character! Excellent!

This Krups Toaster is the best I have ever used! 
Perfect toast every time. The wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides. The lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife. 
The defrost function works great.
If large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally, they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices.
The crumb tray slides out easily, eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster.
All in all, the best toaster I have ever owned

I was going to buy The Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker, because the price was so good , but I waited over three months because it was not in stock so I looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price, but after using it, it's more than twice the machine I think , on the Amazon description it says the pump is a 16-bar pump , But after checking reviews on different web sites I think Amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites ,it says the a pump  to be 17.5 bar pump, that's even better , And the other thing that I like, was the fact that it had a CD , that was not said on the description either , I never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful , shows and explains the basics, from making espresso two frothing the milk ,cleaning tips and more very helpful . 
So I made myself my first shot of espresso , it was great nice little cream on top,  it just looked beautiful , I didn't think it would work to good because I bought some pods, and I wasn't sure how it would work , works  great , taste great and  easy to clean , second day I made myself a latte again excellent.  
Third day I got adventurous I made myself my first cappuccino, and again great put Starbucks to shame.  
The espresso I was using was the ILLY Sucro Espresso Pods 906,
Naturally the espresso you use is actually more important than the machine I guess this one taste great ,about different type of syrups caramel vanilla hazelnuts Irish cream , the syrups brand was daVinci ,So yes I am very satisfied with this machine , and I guess I got lucky because this one was out of stock for a long time

I purchased this in Cobalt Blue. It goes with my Fiestaware dishes, as well as my Pzaltsgraf and Longerberger Pottery. I also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful, and much nicer in person than online. It has a large capacity, and pleasing lines. I'll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals, to be able to use more than one

I had a regular incandescent book like in the same format with the light on an extendable arm.  Lasted a good while but the bulb finally went and I couldn't find a good replacement.  I saw the Triple LED book light and knew right away that it would be perfect.  I looked at a lot of lights and nothing compares to this.  You get great light that you can direct exactly where you need it.  And it only uses AAA batteries! Defintely gets the 5 star rating

I received the shams, and was suprised with the colour.  These are almost a mustard yellow, not what I would call sunlight.  The picture shown reflects a lot of light, thus looking paler.  The quality looks to be good, and I did wash and iron them.  They do look good with my Bedspread (A Blue Laura Ashley Floral) and pick up the yellow in it.  For the price, I think they are a good buy.  It's nice to have a change now and again...

Cuts like a Samurai blade quality, and doesn't need to steel as frequent as the Henckels/ Wusthof knives. It has excellent weight for a medium sized hand. However, the handles get quite slippery when wet, so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety. Also, if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel, DON'T, because this Global blade is much harder than the Henckels/Wusthof blades; a qood quality Diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must, or if you really like the steel design, get the Global steel which can cost quite a bit. Overall, this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed, just like a Samurai would do to get use to his sword

We are using 2 Love seat throws for an old L-shaped sectional sofa. It really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color. The material quality is great for the price. 

The only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping, say about once a day. The throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in-built mechanisms to hold in place (e.g. a velcro system, straps, etc). So you have to put the throw over the sofa again neatly.

If you don't mind arranging the throw about once a day, this will be a very inexpensive and great looking cover for your sofa.

As previously mentioned, while they call this red, it is really a burnt-orange.  If you are trying to match some other red beware!

This stock pot is enamel on steel, not cast iron, it was never meant to be. No reason for any confusion. I've had mine for 5 years, there are no chips or scratches. No matter what I've made; spaghetti sauce, posole or any kind of soup. Nothing has ever burned, nor has the enamel come away from the pot. Turn the heat down, I always get perfect results.
LeCreuset comes with a great guarantee in regards to workmanship and defects. Shame on anyone who purchases cookware in this day and age and doesn't follow up with the manufacturer when there is an issue such as some I've read above

As a vintner we remove the CO2 from the wine as part of our process.  This device uses CO2 to "pop" the cork--very clever.  However this minor introduction of CO2 is insignificant and will vent quickly.  At times there is an off-taste --like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine. Let it breath for a while -- 5 minutes or so and it seems OK.  

This device works well on corks, but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics.  Do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective.

The quality of the china is very good. The weight and feel of the product is substantial. I was disappointed in the color and antique look to them. From the pictures I thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive. They almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family

I've have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths. They are also a nice large size.  So many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they cannot be wrung out properly. The colors of the towels are also beautiful. I'm buying more for our guest bathroom.  Thank goodness I searched on Amazon. I don't believe these wonderful Martex New Splendor items are sold anywhere else

About a month ago, a friend gave me her GF tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen. In return, I grilled up some home-made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper! I really love this grill. Even though it's got a big surface area, it's no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away, and it cleans really easily. My tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm; the charred stuff wipes right off!

I wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles, like the smaller G5 version does. Just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby! I do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage, though, given its size. 

Bottom line: I'd highly recommend this grill, especially if you're using it for a family of four or more

The refill accessory (in both 50 and 70 oz sizes) definitely cuts the refill-maintenance in half. Since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often. You still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended. A different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher-safe, and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual. Throwing caution to the wind I ignored the warning and now have an oddly-shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected

Saw a demo of this at a local Sur la Table and very impressed. The coffee it makes is outstanding. I plan to buy one later this year.

Amazon is being deceptive about price. They state list price is $2400, and they're selling it for $1798.95, at a savings of $601.05. NOT! Look at the Jura-Capresso website. The list for the Impressa F9 is $1799. That brings Amazon's big discount down to a whole $0.05. The higher end Impressa S9 is $2399 (and Amazon claims it is $3200). Do your research. Don't trust Amazon's claims for MSRP

Let me preface my review by saying that I am a 25-year-old woman who isn't really big on doing chores. I got a Dyson for Christmas, and just tried out the dusting brush last week. My immediate reaction was: "THIS IS GENIUS!" It is great for dusting computers, televisions, lampshades, bookcases (mine are unfinished wood with several crevices, so normal dusting never seemed to help), the tops of books, CD organizers, ceiling fan blades, metal bedframes...I have dusted so many things with the Dyson attachment, and it works beautifully. This attachment will not disappoint, trust me. It's already made my life so much easier and cleaner

We bought this canister set to compliment the stoneware we purchased from the same set.  I am especially impressed with the seal used on these canisters.  You would swear it is mechanical; the lids open easily, yet seal tight when simply placing the lid on the canister.  They are very high quality and look much better than the stainless steel ones we were considering before finding these.  Recommended

These sheets were the color, size, and quality described. However, if you tend to roll over, instead of picking yourself up when you turn over while sleeping... your sheets will very quickly begin to ball. Yes, those tiny little balls you get on the clothes you wear. Within about 6 - 8 weeks, the sheets have balls on the areas were the most friction happens. 

They are otherwise great sheets... but they don't act like egyptian cotton. They are thick, warm, but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill (soft twill, mind you), but they don't feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets I paid more money for. Pay for the real thing if you want soft, non-balling sheets

This pan is a good example of Calphalon quality and the design is very versatile. Start a saute on the stove, add ingredients, then put it in the oven for a quick roast or broil. I am also planning to use this to roast pork and chicken in the oven.

The metal handles stay suprisingly cool, I have only had to use a potholder when getting it out of the oven.

I hate washing dishes, but this pan cleans like a dream.

The only thing I don't like about it is the high price

Bought this opener because I was tired of trying to open tall cans with an average size electric opener.Not only does it open cans that are taller, but it does it with ease. Locks on can top, stays on through entire cycle. My last opener would often get half way through the can and miss spot before juming off track. Not this one! I am very pleased

Luigi Bormioli has proven to me that they possess the exceptional quality of service that I would like to be able to expect from all vendors.  When my product arrived broken from shipment, amazone.com would not replace it due to the fact that it was past their deadline.  I contacted the Luigi Bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses.  When they arrived, however, they were the wrong glasses.  I returned them to the company, along with the broken glasses I had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses.  Again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again.  I would highly recommend these glasses and this company

I recently purchased this double boiler and I am very happy with it.  It is a good quality stainless and that is important.  I love the "vintage" style, it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape, much like one that Grandma had many years ago.  The boiler insert is 6" deep, not counting the lid, and perfect for making frosting, candy, custard, anything that requires gentle cooking.

This is a very nice pan for $20.  The non-stick surface works very well, even without cooking oil.  The heavy aluminum heats up very evenly.  The glass lid helps prevent over-cooking.  Of course, non-stick pans are for low-to-medium heat only.  You cannot use this pan for high-heat stir frying

This was one pattern that both my wife and I could agree on.  The design is clean and interesting and should fit with most decors.  I purchased two of the 16 piece sets from Amazon for $...  set and with the free vegtable bowles, no tax and free shipping, this was by far the best deal on the internet.  My first set arrived with two broken salad plates and one broken dinner plate.  My second set arrived with one broken salad plate.  The repacement set arrived with one broken salad plate.  The vegtable bowles arrived intact.  The quality seems to be first rate.  No warped plates or design flaws, but a few item did have some minor cosmetic flaws.  Amazon was GREAT at resolving the damaged goods issues, but needs to seriously rethink the packaging of fragile items.  The only fault I could find with this set is that the soup bowles are a little on the small side.  I recommend that you read and following the cleaning and maintenance directions and this set should give many years of service

I HAVE THESE ON MY BED RIGHT NOW-THEY ARE WONDERFUL. I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE COMPLAINTS ARE ABOUT. I GOT THESE IN A GOLD COLOR AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL...YES, THEY GET WRINKLED. BUT I PUT THEM ON MY BED WHEN THEY ARE STILL HOT OUT OF THE DRYER AND SPRAY THEN WITH A WRINKLE RELEASER WHEN I PUT THEM ON THE MATRESS. I LOVE THEM. I HAVE A 20" WIDE MATRESS AND THEY FIT SO NICELY! FOR THE THREAD COUNT-THE PRICE IS RIGHT! I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THESE AS MUCH AS I DO

Does it look and feel cheap? Yes! Does it do exactly what I expect it to? (Make coffee automatically at a pre-programmed time in the morning) Yes! I've used it to make coffee before I wake up every morning for almost a month, though the design of the pot itself is pretty bad (I kinda expect it to break or otherwise fail sooner or later) it's done the job so far and I can't complain.

I planted these last Wed.  It is now Tues and I think by tommorow I will be able to harvest.  They grow so fast you can't believe it.  When I wake up they look like they have grown so much, by the time I go to bed they are even bigger!!  It was very easy to plant and all I do is make sure they have water.  There is a chance you can get mold, but I have not had that problem.  I will buy more from this seller!  I am looking into the mushroom kits

I purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines. I have had no issues with the decanture being delicate. Infact we machine wash it after each use. The only issue I have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly. Other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture

I like this pan because of the tapered shape.  It cooks sauces without boiling over because it is tall, and it sits perfectly on the small burner with no overlap for even heating.  The handles stay cool, and the clean up is easy.  Beautiful exterior also. Like all All Clad products, this pan is worth the money.  Long lasting and well designed.  The only thing I wish All Clad would add is hash marks on the interior so I could see when I have reduced a sauce to half.

Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. The enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. 

Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. For this reason, it is recommended to use on low to medium heat. There are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Otherwise, cooking with high heat may cause food to stick, discolor the enamel coating, or cook the food unevenly. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well. 

Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain it. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. 

The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically. This pan holds 5 1/4 quarts of food, measures 9 3/4 x 14 x 3 inches internally, and weighs 10.2 pounds. 5 1/4 quarts will typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. Except for roasts, the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot. 

I find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese, while not so desirable for other dishes. Add the Le Creuset 9 x 11 1/2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease. Some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles, pork chops covered with cornbread dressing, dinner rolls, baked squash, lasagna, scalloped potatoes, cobblers, pineapple upside down cake, or bread pudding. The possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination. 

One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. 

PROS: 
Extremely versatile 
Efficient absorption and distribution of heat 
Hygienic enamel cooking surface 
Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors 
Easy to clean when not abused or misused 
Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table 
Can easily last a lifetime 

CONS: 
Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10.2 pounds

We bought this pad for our 2 year-old son's twin bed and it was so nice that we later purchased one for our Queen sized bed.  It is soft and doesn't crinkle and make noise like other pads we've had.  It also washes in the machine really well.  We've washed my son's once a week since we bought it (about 6 months) and it hasn't changed a bit, still appears to be in great condition.  Both the twin and the queen fit our mattresses well

This is by far the best toaster we've ever owned. It does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional, so I don't know how it works yet, but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side. A fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation. The bagels we toasted in it were just perfect!

The microwave is large enough inside for my purposes, which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting. I never use microwave popcorn so I can't say how well it does in that area, but the frozen burrito I cooked last night came out terrific.

Regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving, I think what the company is referring to is the fact that, while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint, it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster. This does indeed save space, not to mention an electrical outlet. Overall, I'm very pleased with it, but haven't had it long enough to speak to its longevity. I can tell you that it's almost worth buying for the toaster alone

It's a three-piece roasting rack--two sides and a long "pin" that holds them together. When assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles. It's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey, and after using it with a 22 lb turkey I believe that claim. The tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan, and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do. In fact, my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our Maxam Steel Roaster, which is currently my favorite roasting pan.

The truly cool thing about this rack, however, isn't the handles or the shape. It's that nifty pin at the bottom. You see, you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin, then you simply remove the sides. That's it. They pull right away from the turkey, leaving it behind on its platter. No more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack; it's right where you want it already.

For all of its non-stick properties the rack did take some real elbow-grease to clean--particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars--but that isn't very surprising. It does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product, however. Also, there is one problem that did bother us; it seems that some of the non-stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking. We thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 F was too high a temperature for the rack, but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that I could find.

I'm still giving this item a rating of four because it's just so incredibly cool an idea, and so remarkably useful, but I have to admit that I'm not thrilled with the idea of a non-stick coating that flakes, and I wish the item was dishwasher-safe. I'd love to see Cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material

Some reviews make it sounds like every EC701 is defective out of the box.  So far, I've made 40 shots of espresso and 10 steamed ciders, and I've been very pleased with the product.  I've been working on improving my technique and now I think the espresso is excellent.  I prefer my homemade shots to the stuff I buy at Starbucks and most other cafes, though this could be due to delusional pride in my own amateur baristaship.  Also, I may be over-excited because I'd wanted an espresso machine for so long.  The negatives (so far) are that it looks like there are is a fair amount of ongoing maintenance cleaning of the machine, though I doubt that this is unique to this brand.  Also, as others have mentioned, the espresso spout is low, so I drink my coffee out of ceramic ramikins (although aren't low spouts authentic?).  Also, I haven't gotten the steamer working quite right and I always end up with cappuccinos (all foam) even if I'm trying to make a latte.  Hopefully I'll get better with time.  As for reliability, I've only made 40 shots, so I can't speak to the long-term quality, but so far, so good.  And heck, 40 espresso drinks at Starbucks would've cost me over $120 by now, although making it at home still isn't free -- if you use the convenient pods, it's still about 50 cents a shot, and Illy beans are expensive (right now, I'm using an unground dark-roasted Kona, which is deep and very smooth)

It makes the cleanest and purest coffee I have ever tasted.  I also use a Moka pot, A french press, and a drip  and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot.  To those who had failures and could not get it apart, I have no idea what you are doing wrong, there is little to go wrong.  FIll the lower pot, put on the upper pot with grinds in it, heat it, watch the water infuse the grinds,, remove from heat and let it  go back down.  What is there to go wrong?  
If it fails to go back to the lower pot there must have been a vacuum leak, pull it apart and let gravity do it, or just stick something in it and dislodge the filter if you are in a hurry.    There is no vacuum up top so how the coffee got "stuck" up there defeats all I know about physics, just dump the stuff into the sink if it fails to go back through the filter; it is pretty simple.  If it doesn't work for you I'd call it user error, try again, If you can boil water this should pose no problem
I have used it 100s of times with not one failure

I have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie I keep looking for the combination of simplicity, cost and excellent coffee - this has all three!
The first two or three times I tried this the coffee didn't come out that good, either too weak or not enough body but now I have it down and the coffee is excellent. I make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day. 
The other good news... I've now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker - it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature  to use in the aeroexpress.

A good way to make a cup of coffee.  Particularly good if you want a fresh brewed taste, but don't need to brew a full pot for only one or two people.  Can be stored in a cabinet or drawer, eliminating the use of counter space.  A must have for small kitchens

This is a massive skillet! Be warned it's heavy, but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan. It's preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great. I would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter, but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down

I like the style, weight and size of this set, but I'm not sure how it is going to hold up in the dishwasher. I've had it about a month and am starting to see some rust like spots on some of the pieces like have been mentioned in other reviews. We'll see if they get worse.

Aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the '4' setting, it's pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it's warmed up (keep it closed).  I modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what I do.    Sure, they occasionally stick and I don't always get the batter in right, and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it's on, but this isn't a $100 device, it's just a nice little waffle maker

I use this in my 29 gallon, and the filter is excellent. The best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in. It is also very quiet. However, when the power goes out and comes back on, it won't begin working again. You must add water to it to get it up and running. This has been a problem when I've gone on vacation and I've come home to cloudy water. The refills are also pretty expensive, and can get a bit messy. It's all worth it, though. It keeps my tank in nice condition. :

Everything about our Miele (Red Velvet) vacuumn cleaner is top notch, including the bags. The nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag. This prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner. 

This is just a small detail, but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company's products

I've had the grind and brew for almost 3 years, and have never had any problems. It makes great coffee, it's not that hard to clean, and it has adjustable settings for temperature and coffee strength, so if you fiddle with it a little, you can get it to make exactly the coffee you want.

I gave one to my cousin a couple of years ago as well, and it turned him into a total coffee addict.

i really like the electric skillet, it is the first one, i have bought. it is big enough to fry a chicken cut in half,both halves at once, and deep enough to make a stew. easy to clean just like promised. the only thing i was not so happy about was the handles. they give a lot, they bend, and one of mine is already broken. but that is really the only complain i have and i consider it a minor and would buy the skillet again

I love this - it keeps the bed toasty. I takes some time to warm up the bed. I turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour. When I get it, it's very nice and I turn it down to 1 or 2. I find if I keep it on 5 all night I roast. I do prefer this product to an electric blanket. It hasn't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills, and it was worth the purchase price. 

If you have a big pillowtop mattress, the pad doesn't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet. Otherwise, I would have given the product 5 stars

Works great. I purchase 3, one for my husband and 2 more for my children. Good design. However, it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a Blackberry, an Ipod and a Gameboy. The station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time

In 1970 I was given a set of Presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle.  At that time they didn't have non-stick griddles.  Through the years the handles broke, but the grill fit over my stainless steel sink, so no problem.  In 1999 I figured it was time to replace it with a new one.  I really loved it because it never stuck and once again I could rely on it.  In 2002 I started a Pancake Breakfast to raise money for our club.  It started with my Presto grill and soon I added a second one.  Over the next 18 months we raised $3,500 with those two grills, serving pancakes, french toast, bacon, etc.  My 3rd grill is still going strong and puts out our Sunday breakfasts at home.  It is so refreshing to be able to depend upon the quality of an appliance these days.  Thank you Presto

This is a fine dehyrator. It's quick and powerful. The description says the trays are 13.5 inches but that text was lifted from the description for the FD-50/60. This model (FD-1010) has 15.25 inch trays which adds almost one square foot to the area of the 13.5 inch tray. Multiply those larger trays by 30 (the maximum capacity) and you got a huge amount of drying surface

I was a little hesitant to spend over $10 for a splatter screen as most of them really aren't worth more than a few bucks.  However, I am VERY glad that I spent the extra money on this one.

The quality of this item is top notch.  It's much more sturdy than any others that I've seen.  I've been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it.  The feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes.  The handle is terrific (some screens only have either a D ring on the top or a thin handle) and seems to stay cool while in use.

This even got raves from my mother

This machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well. The fan is very quiet. I like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well. My only complaint is that the blue LCD that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is VERY bright. Too bright for a bedroom. Really lights it up. I'll be looking for some way of safely masking it. Otherwise very nice but hope it lasts

I needed a canister vacuum that wasn't too expensive that did a decent job on my hardwood and laminate floors.  This vacuum worked out well.  All we had was an upright and it just didn't cut it for our floors.  This turned out to be a good product for the price

I bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend.
At the end of a hot day, the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside.; this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside.
It barely fit the width of my window, but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem. Very easy to install and operate, there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high.
Perfect for smaller rooms.
Also the price is definitely right.

This mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot.  I would expect to pay much more for such a product.  The grind is even and consistent.  The appearance is sleek and modern, yet classic.  I would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift.

As a person who loathes cheap, clutter, infomercial  widgets I bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would be returned the same day.  This opener is large, requires an electric plug and takes up counter space.  But to my surprise it works amazingly well.  There is a foil cutter that is stored in the base.  The screw enters cleanly and seems to eliminate broken and shredded corks which can be frustrating.  Hold the button again and the cork emerges from the device and drops out.  I always liked my sturdy and simple stainless steel opener.  But this turned out to be a keeper. It's design is contemporary and clean, although it looks like it should do something more profound than just pull a cork. It's also a conversation piece provoking smiles from guests. A pleasant surprise, highly recommended and especially so for a person who lacks hand or wrist strength.

This pillow looks simple enough, but there must have been a lot of research put into inventing it!  The DogBone (medium size, about 16"w--i don't remember specific dimensions) instantly relieved many aches i had in my neck without forcing me to lie down in a flat position (which often gives me a headache and makes it impossible to read while lying down).  I'd been to the doc quite a few times for the back/neck problems i've had lately, but no Rx worked quite as well as this delightful cushion.  My only issues with it are cleaning (stuffing's packed very tight, so i'd rather not try it out in the washer for fear of mold/mildew; i spray it with disinfectant every once in a while instead) & the outer material (an optional moisture-wicking or allergen-reducing pillowcase would be nice).  However, I bought it based on earlier reviews, and I don't regret it

Since I have been pleased with my T-Fal pressure cooker, I purchased this pan based on the quality of craftsmanship. I like this pan for frying. Its stainless steel with the thick aluminum heat diffuser bottom makes it robust (it is warp free). Other aluminum pans tend to warp over time. The nonstick surface seems to be less prone to scratches. However, I always recommend non metallic utensils for piece of mind. The center heat indicator is helpful to know when it's ready.

I wish I had gotten one of these a long time ago.  Easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses.  My wife can even use it without burning stuff - which she admits is a feat for her - so she uses it several times a week too.  It holds heat well, cleans up easy, and the lip on the corner works great for draining.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove - with gas you should be fine.  It hasn't seemed to effect the performance though, and for the money it is quite perfect

I just received this griddle today and am SO disappointed to find on the small print on the box (and NOT in Amazon's description!) that this griddle can NOT be used on ceramic top stoves. It's a beautiful piece of cookware, heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges. Exactly what I wanted, but very unfortunate that Amazon doesn't tell you that it won't work with some stoves. The warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top. Probably would have given it 5 stars if I could have used it

Many of you reading these reviews may be wondering how this compares to similar items made of cast iron.   I can tell you that, while it obviously isn't cast iron and for that reason alone many will say it is inferior, it is still an excellent griddle.

The bottom is very heavy and it conducts heat well.  It fits perfectly over 2 burners on one side of my gas stove.  I've cooked several sandwiches at once on it as well as pancakes and some eggs, and the heat seems to distribute very evenly.  I was very impressed with this aspect of the griddle, as cast iron is known for its even heating and I was wondering how an aluminum griddle would hold up; it definitely does a fine job.

The bonus, of course, is the nonstick surface, and it's a good one, not some chintzy teflon coating. Good quality construction.  The handles are solid and it doesn't feel cheap at all when you hold it.  Take care of this griddle (make sure it doesn't get scratched) and it will take care of you

I have a manual sharpener, but in reality almost never use it. The electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no-brainer. There's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull. For most knives the fine- and polishing-grinder works just great. If you have inexpensive knives, the coarse grinder will chew them up, but if you have well-made knives the Waring will work well. I've had good success with the Waring

    Took the pan home and promptly fried a steak on high, thereby causing an apartment full of smoke and a pile of burnt crud on the pan, including a large stain, seemingly impossible to get off.  Tried everything including the company's recommended bleach method.  No luck!  Then I tried baking soda as suggested in one of the reviews here, and it just simply wiped away the damage.  Like new!......Then I set about reading the instruction booklet and have had great results using low heat.  It's really a different way of cooking, but the fried stuff comes out just as if I'd used high heat on another pan.  Stainless steel's great, too, of course, but this is a worthy and earthy alternative.  I take the perspective that the ceramic layer gives the pan a solid foundation for the seasoning process.

We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years.  They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.  

I have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below, but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together, not just by the handle.  Fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand.  

(They are made like hotel china, essentially.  Homer Laughlin is a hotel china company, in fact.  The first set of dishes I had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line.)

For a bigger cup for cafe au lait style, I can recommend the Fiestaware "jumbo cups."  We have a set of those in Sea Mist and use them for coffee, but also for heating soup in the microwave.  They are both great.  Never been disappointed with Fiestaware

We have owned the Breadman Corner Bakery for about eight months now.  It has made our house smell wonderful.  I have to say I don't use the recipes that came with it, so I won't judge those.  For the price this is a beautiful machine.  The pan has a solid heft to it, not like some of the other bread makers with seemingly flimsy aluminum pans.  We have made many types of bread in it and have even churned butter from heavy cream.  The best kind of bread is the one made in the pan right after making butter.  With a toddler and a baby, it is nice not to have to run to the store everyday to buy fresh bread or rolls.  The only time our bread has turned out not so good is when an ingredient has been forgotten.  Without the yeast it wasn't quiet the same but our house smelled great

I bought this heater to head my bedroom/finished basement.  The room is 16'x21' with 9 food ceilings.  The heater does a fantastic job at heating the room, though takes a while (~1 hour) to do so.... which is fine with me.  I really like the fact that it is dead quiet and has a convienent lcd timer.  
My only complaint is that it is rather large/long

I was lucky to get the Stainless Popper on Clearance.  It is wonderful. We have used it for several months now.  It is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn.  I am so disappointed that Target is not carrying the stainless model anymore.  My college children who don't live at home want their own, even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan.  I'm sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models.  When I bought mine, I chose stainless because I knew it could handle the high heat well - and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher.  Hey, Target, how about carrying the stainless model again?

I bought a few of these collars out of desperation. In the past, my cats got out of any kind of safety collar within an hour of putting them on.  Since I was moving recently, I was especially afraid of the cats getting lost during the move or at our new home.  I bought these collars because of the reviews, and everything that the other reviewers say is true.  The only thing I'll add is that one of my cats managed to chew through his collar over the course of several months, but it's still the only kind I'll use for him.  At this price, I can easily afford replacements

We had our kitchen gutted and completely redone. I built a knife holder to use in a drawer. Now, with the Wusthof 25-slot, I have removed my home-made holder. The drawer can be used to store other items. I can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years. There is no need to buy a lot of new knives. Just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives. Having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use. You can't go wrong with this super storage block

We bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our Braun corded hand blender.  The Cuisinart took care of the problem.

Pros:  Very good power for blending, good battery charge life, easy to clean, clever modular construction (battery separates from motor, built-in plug and charger), does not roll off counter.

Cons:  Larger and heavier than the corder Braun.  This blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands.  Very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16" long.

The surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth, making clean-up easy.  I don't recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time.  The heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft. Hand washing is easy and quick.

One reviewer suggested that Cuisinart's recommendation of leaving the battery pack/charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for NiCad batteries.  This may shorten the battery life, but the charger charges them at a very slow rate;  this protects the batteries from what really damages them:  heat from fast charging.

As the charger draws only 1 watt of current, some may want to leave it plugged in continuously.

Current recommendations for care of NiCad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power.  Don't run them down completely as was the practice in the past.  The Cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight.  They don't feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life

For big birds, rib roasts, etc., you need a long knife to get a clean even slice. This knife delivers. It has great lines, and a ballanced feel. The forged blade is thin and flexible, yet still drives from the handle. The blade follows your directions well, and doesn't wander during a cut. A real gem with top quality construction. I'm a big fan of three rivet durability, but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that I chose them for the last three knives I purchased. Blade for blade, these knives are the best around. At this price, you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years

I got tired of dragging out my trusty box grater to do small jobs like grating nutmeg, ginger or Parmagiana Reggiano so I picked this little gem up. It feels good in your hand (no surprise there...it's what Oxo is known for)is well-made and cleans up beautifully...every time. It is so easy now just to grab this guy and grate what needs to be grated that I find I am using whole spices more and more. Grab yourself one of these...you'll love it

Being used to the swiftness of the Roomba (10 stars!), the Scooba seems very slow. It does not follow the wall as much as the Roomba but at the end of the cycle, the floor is clean and sweet-smelling.
On the downside, my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so I have to put up barriers to keep the Scooba on the hard surface only. In rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet, Scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine

Getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic. This is a big help.  The wide base allows better balance than you would think, and is really very secure.  I would prefer a larger balance point, but this does the job

I just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum. It cuts the cleaning time in half from 8-10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop, and spraying the box down- down to only 2 minutes. It's just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes/litter maid products I've seen. And the price is reasonable. 
I wish I had this for my previous cats I've owned

If you are terrible at making rice as I am, this is a very helpful product.  The liquid tends to boil over if cooked at high temp in my microwave.  I cook the rice at 50% power for about 50% longer than the directions recommend and it comes out perfectly.  Easy clean up in the dishwasher.  It is a bit of a pain to store, but I'd buy it again.  Also comes with a steamer insert for cooking vegetables, etc. but I haven't tried that yet

I like the idea of this bundt pan.  I made 3 batches of chocolate truffles on it. The recipe that comes with the pan is awesome.  HOWEVER, I have yet to figure out how to get the chocolates out easily. The first time, I used a non-stick spray (not vegetable oil).  I thought that might be my problem because the company recommends vegetable oil. On the next two batches, I poured vegetable oil in the little holes and spread it around using a pastry brush. Again, I had to fight to get the chocolates out. I kid you not -- my husband pounded on the pan with a big rubber mallet to get the chocolates to come out!  I must be doing something wrong. I will call customer service tomorrow -- but if there is a trick to this, they should have told you on the instructions on how to make the truffles!  Other than that, the chocolates turned out beautifully and I will use this pan again, even if I have to call my husband to help me out with his rubber mallet

This is a wonderful item that your cat will love. I originally purchased a thermal mat from another website (more expensive with a pattern that I didn't like). My 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it, so I did a search and when I found this one, I ordered one for each of them. This cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that I just ordered 3 more, for my dad, sister and a friend to give to their cats. I've seen similar thermal cat mats for $50+. The pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux-sheepskin. My cats like both sides. You can throw them in the washing machine and fur doesn't stick to the smooth patterned side, which is nice. Of all of the cat beds I have purchased, including a heated window-mounted bed that plugged into the wall, this mat is my kitties' favorite thing to sleep on

This claims to be 100% cotton, but my girlfriend who isn't allergic to cotton broke out in insane hives all over her body.  We figured it was the blanket because we didn't use it on some days and one day it was horrible, she was using that only.

It's probably cursed by the devil.

Aside from this, it's nice, soft, and also light enough to use as a summer blanket, which I plan on doing.

This product was much better than I expected. I have owned a Cuisinart hand held mixer for over 10 years and it recently gave up the ghost (too many cookies)!
So in searching for a replacement I tried a KitchenAid mixer instead. What a disappointment! It didn't have the power I had experienced with my 7 speed Cuisinart. I didn't want to spend more money on another 7 speed (and I couldn't find one locally) so I decided to try the 3 speed figuring I would have to settle for a degrading in power.
Surprise, surprise the 3 speed is just as good if not better than my previous 7 speed and less than half the price!
I would definitely recommend this mixer. Good product and I have always found Cuisinart's customer service people to be helpful when I have had to call

I love these glasses.

I think the traditional stemmed wine glass is fine, but I find this far more practical, while being elegant at the same time.

I have the set for Sauvignon Blanc as well, which are very nice.

I'll be buying more.

I bought one of these in August of this year.  I used it daily to make a ham/egg/cheese/english muffin sandwich every morning with great results.  However, after about a month, the non-stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan.  I called Back To Basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days.  The new pan has been in use for two months without issue.  The people at Back To Basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle.

Some people reviewing this product have complained about the stainless steel water boiler becoming dirty from minerals and scalded meat juice.  Others have complained about the egg being soaked in water from steaming and/or sticking in the pan.  I have overcome these problems by doing the following:

I bought a gallon of distilled water that I use in the water compartment (at an ounce or two per use, a gallon will last a long time).  This prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum (keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum, therefore speeding cooking time).  Every three or four uses, I wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down.  After cooking everything, I remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork, tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water, then remove the egg with the plastic fork.  I use store-brand spray oil and have never had an egg 'stick' in the pan.  I have found that if I want toast/an english muffin/a bagel to be pretty crispy, I have to run it for two toaster cycles.  

All in all this is a great product.  Butter consumption in my house has decreased dramatically, and I'm not making a huge buttery mess on the stove every morning.  Plus there no dirty spatula and frying pan to deal with every day.

I owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once. But this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly, at first. But after only about 6 weeks of use, the flip-up spout broke off - actually just broke in half. I replaced it with a Chantal teakettle and so far so good

Wow- This speaker is fantastic!!! It took a little time to get it setup but once we figured it out, it worked like one of our top quality indoor speakers!!! When I read the reviews I was hopeful but not sure. Now we love it and would recommend it to anyone!  We can use it in the font yard, down by the swings and even in the basement(Which we did for our son's pirate brithdday bash). 

Please don't pass this up!  If you are in the market for an outdoor speaker, this is great!  It may take a little time to set up but worth it.  Enjoy!!

I bought this knife and block set as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it.  Our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on Amazon or, for that matter, on the box it arrived in.  The picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives.  The block we got is the one now shown in the Amazon add.  Apparently Henckel made a change in their set about the same time I ordered it.  We can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for $50 more than what I paid for it in December 03.  I would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me. The knives are well crafted, have a great feel, extremely sharp and we love them.  There were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another Henckel knife we already owned and one other. We also love the selection of knives, especially the paring knife and small serrated knife. Some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we've not noticed either of these conditions

I absolutely adore these Kyocera knives, they are the sharpest things I have ever seen.  

I ordered this through Witbecks, and the first one got lost in the mail -- that can always happen.  When I contacted Matt Witbeck he responded immediately (that night, from home) and the next day sent me a replacement.  I have never had such prompt and unquestioning customer service, and so I want to recommend Witbecks to anyone

This fan is incredibly powerful. It can definitely move air around a room. My one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium. I don't know if it's just mine that is that way or not and it isn't a big deal since I bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and I'll tell ya, when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse

I just got into wine a little while ago, and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home, rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler.  But seeing as how I'm anywhere near wine snob status, I didn't want to spend a bunch on a set.  

Enter the Riedel O glasses.  They were on sale, great price for two glasses.  They arrived and I'm happy with them.  They're sophisticated enough to be wine glasses, but without the stems, they're not snobby either.  I would have given this 5 stars, but one of the glasses I received has a minor imperfection along the rim, almost a little bubble of glass, or crystal.  Other than that, they're great

Cons:
Have lint coming off when trying to wipe wet skin. 
Still need to put it through a wash to see if it leeches colour

These cups are high quality stainless steel.  Don't worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink.  I was surprised by their weight and long handles.  My old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups.  These MIU cups are extremely sturdy.  The handles on my old cups were more typical too, while these MIU cups all have very long handles(~4.5").  At first I didn't like the asthestics of the handles, nor the fact that the smaller ones don't stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates.  However, when I needed to scoop something out of a small-mouthed container, I quickly reversed my opinion of these handles.

Cricisms: The interior has perpendicular corners.  I prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying.  Still, it doesn't make much of a difference.  Also, while they're not hard to store, they don't stack all that well, so they'll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers(~5.5").  I suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease.

(...) for the 5 cups, I'm extremely satisfied.  I feel these are top of the line.  The 7 cup set is overpriced (...), so definitely go with these.  I don't understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2/3 and 3/4 cups?  Just use the 1/3 cup twice or the 1/4 three times...or eyeball the 1 cup.

Most importantly, this is SMALL.   This is the same size as one-person clay pot rice or bibimbap.  It is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout.  One cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion.  

I have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around.

Now that I have received my shipment, I know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but I have grown to prefer the red.  It's so pretty. 

It didn't arrive chipped or anything so there's not much to say about how it works.  Just keep the heat between medium to low.  I broke it in by making hot milk (from powder) with banana so yeah, as a pot, it heats stuff up.  No leaks. 

p.s. one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that I saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating - yes I did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in.  I still don't know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but I hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies. 

I think this Try Me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl

I bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class Valentine's Day Party.  It was the talk of the whole school.  The kids loved it.  I used Sephra chocolate (a coupon was included), so I didn't have to mess with adding any oil.  The chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression.  The cascading, flowing, chocolate wasn't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box, but it probably would have if I would have added a teenie bit of oil, but the pure Sephra chocolate tasted devine.  I also saved $25.00 by buying the CHP (champaigne color) version

When I was looking to purchase a new machine, I only was looking for a Bunn. Bunn makes the best coffee machines, none can compare. Every diner, coffee house, and Dunkin' Donuts only use Bunn machines. The A10 is one great machine! Brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly. Everyone in my office is very happy with the unit. If you're a serious coffee drinker, please don't cheap out on a Mr.Coffee, Braun or Krupps-- frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed, temperature, or taste of a Bunn unit. I bought the A10 to replace a Bunn unit that I used for 10 years without a glitch

I really like this bookcase.  It is attractive, and easy to set up.    
Simply fold the shelves into place.  Although it is easy to set up, it is pretty sturdy.  There are spaces in the back that items could fall through, but there are wood slats to hold books in place.  I also like the size of the bookcase: it is not too wide but holds a lot because it is tall, and the mission sides are nice

I have found this to be the best I have ever owned.  My daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and I just had to have a Bunn also.  I envied my daughter's ability to make coffee in literally three minutes.  I used to only have 12-cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now.  The best is that you can always have a "fresh" cup of coffee and it is always hot. It makes a "clean" cup of coffee easily and efficiently.  We are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone.  This will be our brand of coffee maker forever

This pan is a good buy and a wonderful size for 2-3 member families.  Although not as heavy as some of the french copper pans, I have many of the Commercial Calphalon pieces and love the handle.  The pan is definately heavier than cheap quality pans and the stainless interior is just what I wanted for acidic based cooking (tomato sauces, etc).  As far as scratches, well, what do you expect?  If you use it, it is going to get some scratches... the brushed exterior helps hide some of the outside marks though.  Some have complained about &quot;scratches&quot; on the other Calphalon hard anodized, but most of the time, they really aren't scratches, but rather aluminum marks from the rivets when stacking. In any case, they are easily removed with scotchbrite and some cleaner!  Enjoy!  P.S.  I chose the &quot;no shipping cost&quot; delivery and received the pan in just 4 days!

This is a big saucepan!  I got it for Christmas because I needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines.  This has become my favorite pot for many things; from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night.  The see-through lid is great for monitoring food as it's cooking, and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring.  It is traditional Calphalon quality with a modern look, and I love it

I got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded Sweet & Low packages. I love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances. The item itself works pretty good for the most part. The only issue I have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it. to remedy the issue, I am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place.

I'm not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate. Perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find. I used search terms like "mini trash can," counter top trash can," "small waste basket," small stainless steel trash can," but none of these got me to this item. I'm not sure how my husband finally found it.

I bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday.  I'm sure she's going to enjoy using it.  I had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing.  It was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied. Now I just have to get one for myself.  Well, my birthday is coming up in February

Bought this vacuum because Consumer Reports picked it as one of the 2006 best buys.  Better than Dyson or Rainbow.  This is our second Eureka, but this one is significantly better than the last.  The last was a bagless model, and this one uses bags, and as a result it's much easier to clean.  Bags are quite inexpensive, so it only adds about $10-15 per year (6-9 bags).  Suction is fantastic.  Noise is low.  IT's easy to use.  And I will add that we purchased a "refurbished" model, but we can identify no defects or differences.  Looks perfectly new and runs great.  So the choice is yours:  Dyson for $400+ or this one which is better for $99 ??

I would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps.  Currently, they're working on chewing up the shelves.   

So I'm off to buy one that's entirely wire.  Wish I had done that in the first place

It was such a hit I have two now they got one for me before they left saying now you gots two so next time we come you can ride too. Overall great, strong, and fun:

Shamu is ready for you to ride him! Be gentle though... he hates rough tubers and riders, he can't withstand heavy duty people on him! If a heavy rider tries to "Inner Tube Giddy-Up" him, he'll be over forced in his body chamber and will POP! BE CAREFUL! Liste

Hunter fan arrived in 2 days from Amazon.com and immediately I noticed the weight of the fan...heavy, just the way I like it. Unpacked this beauty and plugged her in and off she went with a beautiful sound. I love the 3 wing blade and the speed variation is great...from barely running to blow your hat off......we love it, keep up the good work Hunter. I intend to buy one for a Christmas gift also.

I wanted to dress up my kitchen a little, and this does the trick (makes me not dread washing the dishes.  An added plus!).  It's a nice cherry red, and I'm a bit of a "red junkie."  

I gave this five stars because it's perfect for my needs.  If you have a large family and tons of dishes it's going to be on the small side though.  The red colander's a great extra, as is the little sponge holder (it has suction cups to keep it in place, but mine doesn't seem to stay stuck.  That's a minor detail, though, and it could have more to do with my kitchen's tiling than the suction cups).  

One thing to note--if your sink's drains aren't centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat.

Overall, this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set.  What more could we want?

I bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office.   I was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it.   I'd looked at the small Haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior.  

I broke a lot of rules setting this up.   Its not connected to the hot water supply, since I have a very old sink and the only other connection I had was to cold water lines.   Also, the machine is on the floor, under the sink.   I bought new hoses to make the connections.   Luckily, the standard connectors on the back made this easy -  the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line, and the drain can take a piece of garden hose.   I was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water, but so far its been okay. (If I was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home, I might not be so nonchalant.)

My unit was used, from an area where there was very hard water, and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine.   I soaked everything in CLR to remove the scale from the sump grill, the heating element and the wash arm,  and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal, and away we went.

Since we are in an office, we always use the Sanitary wash to keep the cooties down.  The machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot, and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over, if you pop the door open.  The machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink.  

One reason I avoided the plastic tub Haier is noise.  If you load this machine carefully, you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much, and the machine will operate more quietly.  We've found that we can run the machine, have the office radio on, and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble.

My only complaints would be that on occasion, the timer has gotten stuck (once or twice in 100 washes).  Also, some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater.  Capacity is very decent, probably because the machine is pretty large.  Measure first

I purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep. I have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans. My son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus, saying he hasn't slept this good in a long time.  the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and I too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom.  Very sturdy steel construction, easy assembly of the legs. 3 speeds. Top speed is out of this world. Almost like a wind storm. Me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house. What a riot!  I highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation, sleep aid and some silly fun

I have used Patton air circulators for the last twenty years,
and if you are looking for something much more effecient than
the common box fan that you see in department stores, this is
really a fan. The first one I bought had the C.F.M. rating on
it, which was 9600----They don't put that on the fan anymore,
but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate some
air, and can be adjusted to blow straight up. Nothing I have
seen even comes close for the money---

Apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new S5 series of Miele vacuum cleaners, the features, price, and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models, nor even across series.  Many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones.  They have fancy names like Capricorn, Red Velvet, and Champagne, leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car.  If your browser has tabbed browsing (e.g., Firefox), the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to Miele's website and open a tab for each model you're interested in.  Flip back and forth to see what text changes.  Callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series (newest technology motor?) that still comes with an electronically powered brush (the 4th Pisces model is turbo).

After 3 months of extensive use:

Pros:
Agility - The 10 �" wide SEB217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard, and one of the reasons I chose this model.  For me, smaller is better.  While other vacuums advertise large 13" power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe, I don't have much open carpet space.  Coffee tables, chairs, weight benches, and computers, all need vacuuming around and under.  The powerbrush swivels well to get around corners.

Brush duster - The most commonly used attachment (for me), the brush duster is also small (slightly larger in diameter than the hose) and the bristles are durable.  It's angled by default, but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out.  This is not mentioned anywhere; you just have to figure this out for yourself.  On low power, I was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before, like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires.  I even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk.

Parquet floor brush - Initially, I wondered why Miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included, but this "wider brush duster" actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush.  The powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets, but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better.  On the negative side, you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust, and I wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for "genuine horse bristles".  There is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush, so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don't get separated for life (the powerbrush takes precedence).

Cord rewind - The mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time, something like 15 for 15 times!  (The manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat.)

Cons:
Price - After all, it's just a vacuum cleaner.  There also seems to be price fixing in the newer S5 series, at least when I bought this.  Everywhere I checked (maybe 10 websites), the price was exactly $799 or $799.95, with the only difference being no tax and/or free shipping.  One website even advertised "The lowest price allowed!"  What's a Diamond Dealer?  Is this Amway?

Release buttons - The release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive, being on the part that "comes off" rather than on the part that "stays behind".  Therefore, you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with.  The hose extension button is particularly confusing.  It's an oval shaped rocker button that "rocks" very little.  To extend the stainless steel hose, you have to remember which side of the button (top or bottom) to press.  There is no distinction on which side to press, and it's always a matter of trial and error as I yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button.

Stiff no swivel hose - The hose rotates at the top (handle area), but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine.  Instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists, I'd rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists.  The flex hose diameter is larger than I'm used to, making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where I used to store my old vacuum cleaner.  Considering the price, an electrical slip ring would have been nice.

Bag full indicator - The mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck.  Put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full.  Right out of the box on short carpet, it indicated bag full on high power.  As I turned the power down, it indicated less full sequentially.  You have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator.  Even at that, there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator.

Extra stuff? - The parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose (button doesn't easily click into place).  The extension isn't needed to connect the parquet brush, so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it.  To this day, I still haven't figured out what the extension is for, other than to connect other attachments that I might buy in the future.  This is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that I must ensure does not get separated for life (along with the parquet brush, "normal" filter cage, and replacement bags).

Symbol marking - The power symbol markings are not obvious at all, contrary to claims.  Other than the symbols labels "Min" and "Max", you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean.  At least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise.  The Quite Mode is #4 of 6 settings (with 6 being the highest), and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the "normal" operating mode.  I think most people will consider "Max" the default mode.

Optional filter frame - This model comes with a HEPA filter, so you don't need the filter frame unless you're going to switch to the "normal" filters, but brand-new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle, apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping.  You don't even need the handle for the frame to function properly, but for the kind of money I paid, nothing should be broken out of the box.  The vendor that I bought it from (Best Vacuum) replaced it for free.

So is it worth $800?  It does a good job, but only time will tell..

They aren't kidding--this thing is razor-sharp.  It needed no tuning up before I used it for the first time.  The handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight... which is unfortunate, because I like the weight for chopping.  But the hollow-edge design is wonderful--the mushrooms and onions I sliced up were thin as paper, and didn't stick to the blade.  I'd recommend it

the cheaper ones don't quite fit... unfortunate because these are so expensive...  which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars...  I would give five for the product, but the price really is outrageous...  They know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers (Hamilton Beach, not Amazon)...  too bad the makers of these machines don't have the users in mind, instead of their bank accounts...  They take advantage of people who NEED these humidifiers

This came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the Holidays.  As a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation.  As a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb. chickens.  It's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck.  The pan looks good from oven to table.  Yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron, but I'm really glad to add this to my pantry.

My husband was skeptical, why do you need a new $200 pot he said.  Well I bought the dutch oven, with two days of receiving it I made the best beef stew he has ever had.  He said the meat was much more tender than when I make the stew in a crock pot.  Never again will he question me when I say I need a kitchen tool

I destroy cooking pots.  I'm especially lethal to the light-weight teflon lined variety you'll find at the supermarket.  My secret is simple:  I like to cook on high heat and I get easily distracted.  That guarantees that I'll forget what's on the stove and produce a scorched (and warped) utensil.  If a lightweight teflon pot lasts me two years, it's extraordinarily lucky.  

I now own four (different) Swiss Diamond pots.  And even my brutal habits leave them unimpressed.  Despite regular disasters, they seem to shrug off what would vanquish a lesser pot.  (Admittedly, I do avoid metal spoons and spatulas and clean them with non-abrasive means.)  They have excellent non-stick characteristics, superb heat-spreading, and -- love it -- are approved for very hot oven use.  Adding up to ESSENTIAL cooking tools!  

And when you factor the price of regularly replacing "cheaper" pots, their cost becomes more than bearable.  

HIGHLY recommended

We are really good about packing up our meat, vegis and fruit right after purchase. Our vacuum sealer has saved us tons of money just from not tossing out stuff that goes bad quickly. The sealer came with rolls to make our own bags, but I found it too cumbersome; these bags eliminate the difficulty.

Do your banana's turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them?  This used to be a huge problem in my house.  But now that I have the Lipper Beechwood Collection Banana Hanger this is no longer an issue.

I hang my bananas up the moment I get home from the grocery store.  They think they are still on the tree out in the wild!  Silly bananas...

Green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer.  Once, I got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger!

The Lipper Beechwood Collection Banana Hanger is compact and doesn't take up much counter space which is a definite plus.  And it's almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display

I had a Pampered Chef sprayer that I loved, but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years. I should have tried harder to find a Pampered Chef rep to buy another one, the Pampered Chef one works better than this one.

However, this is not a horrible product. One drawback compared to the Pampered Chef one is that you can't see through this one to see how high the oil level is. You want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway, and when it is less than 1/3 full you need to fill it back up or it won't work as well. This unit is even more finicky than the Pampered Chef one about the level, it almost won't spray if the level is too low. But since you can't see through it, even holding it up to the light, you have to look down in and estimate how high it is. The reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is. You don't want to fill it all the way up, either.

Then, you need to pump it more than the Pampered Chef one needed to be pumped. This one sprays a very fine spray, finer than the Pampered Chef one. And it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there. 

I think I know why my old one got clogged. So I'm trying something new: each time I'm done, before I put it away, I twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure. I think if you leave it pressured up all the time, like I did with my old one, it damages the nozzle over time. But time will tell if I'm right.

Another tip -- don't fill it with anything but olive oil. Other oils evaporate and leave a sticky/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer. You know what I mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot, you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it. Olive oil doesn't do that, that's why I now don't use anything else on my stovetop (except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying). This type of sprayer will work much better if you just use Olive Oil in it, trust me.

But if you have a choice, go find a Pampered Chef rep and by their sprayer. It's cheaper and better quality

Cooking is actually a pleasure when you have tools that are as colourful and cheerful as this little pot. It is just beautiful to look at, and a joy to use. (I never thought I could get so excited about a simple pot!) This little green pepper cooks evenly, in the oven or the stovetop, and clean up is a breeze. I've use this to make casseroles for 2-4, sides for 4-6, even soups and sauces. Jambalaya is one dish particularly well-suited for this pot -- straight from simmering on the stove to the table, it's gorgeous. I'm planning to get the tomato or pumpkin next

Our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine.  Having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this.  The lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute.  These sheets have held up well so far and feel great.  If you get the ruby color, make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs.

What people don't think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug.  I'm not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it.  I have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there, which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross.  Especially water.  Who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face?  Not me.  Not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything.  It smells good and I can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some.

A great mug you should buy.

This bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up.  I use mine constantly, and didn't think I would when I bought it.  We reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters I own.  I love my Fiestaware, you can't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes

When I got this I was a little worried it would be too cheapy b/c the materials are light-weight.  But, I set to putting it together and the directions were VERY easy and all the pieces were there and when I got done I was estatic.  It was just so easy and looked so good! I have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer. Unlike other reviewers, I find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all.  Maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts

I was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but I gave this set a try and love it. The pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable. Clean up is a breeze.  I am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces.

I consider this coffee pot to be near perfect.  It has no "auto turn on" feature, but i never use that anyway.  The only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens, but it soon becomes habit.  

My favorite feature has to be the water filter. It really improves the coffee flavor. It's also compact. I gained a little more counter space

I personally haven't heard a peep about SilverStone in ages, and frankly, when I bought this item, I didn't even realize it was made by them. I needed new muffin pans, so I just looked for the best deal, price-wise. I saw this set, and figured it was as good as any.

When I received them, I was ecstatic. When you think of something relatively trivial like this, you don't really expect much in the way of quality, but man, was I wrong! These things are weighty, very well constructed, and have durable written all over them. I consider it a huge upgrade from my old, flimsy no-name tins, and I highly recommend them for anyone who, like me, bakes a lot and really just doesn't want to worry about replacing these kinds of things too often

I threw out all of my old tupperware cups that my kids were using and switched to a supply of Fiestaware ceramic cups.  Now that my kids are all over 5, we don't need all that ugly plastic.  These are durable and attractive.  A range of colors lets them keep track of which cup is theirs.  Plus, it matches my other dinnerware.  It's the perfect size for them.   When they get older and need a bigger glass, these are perfect for juice

As a Le Creuset cast iron fan, it was only natural that one day I would try out their stoneware products.  While maintaining the same color options and increasing their product offerings, I still prefer the cast iron products over the stoneware.  Even so, there are times when the stoneware fits a need the cast iron cannot effectively fulfill.

The stoneware is not intended for use on the stovetop.  Besides this, the stoneware can go from the oven/microwave, to the table, and then to the refrigerator.  Virtually non-porous, Le Creuset's Stoneware is fired at 2156 degrees making it resistant to chipping, cracking, and staining. The enameling results in an easy to clean and scratch resistant surface, and will not absorb odors or flavors, and resists moisture absorption.  This line is sure to perform for many years.

The stoneware line has many of the same qualities the cast iron line is known for.  This pie dish can be used for ice-cream pies, crisps, cobblers, pies, Shepard's pie, tamale pie, or any other number of dishes.

PROS:
Fits a need Le Creuset's cast iron line sometimes cannot
Same high quality standards found in Le Creuset's cast iron line, but lighter weight
Made to last for many years

CONS:
Not intended for use on the stoveto

I was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price.  I was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion.  This set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand.

Although this set comes with a sharpener, I recommend getting the W�sthof 2904 Knife-Life knife and scissor sharpener.  You will not need to sharpen these knives much, but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house.

I also recommend, as others have, to never place these knives in the dishwasher.  Also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use.  This will drastically increase their longevity.

If you purchase these, and I propose you do so, then get a travel roll bag for knives.  This is because you will want to take them to friends' and family's homes to "show them off"

This mug absolutely comes through as promised.  Hot beverages stay hot even hours later.  It's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning.  I am very pleased with this purchase!  The only thing that I am not completely satisfied with is it's size.  I would have preferred something a little wider, but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for.....unfortunately it tends to move around in mine, but it doesn't spill any thing

This cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy. It heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before. It also heats very evenly. The only negative thing I have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon. However I think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or Pam fixes the problem

My pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind.  He jumps to pull the beas out of the hive.  He squeaks the beas.  Perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head.  He went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it.  It is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads.  He likes the wing detail for chewing on.  This toy gives exercise.  I am so glad I tried it.  He plays with the hegehog on his own.  Those are the 2 best toys.  The squirels from the hide a squirel are fun, but the game holder is not something he was really excited about.  These interactive toys are great.  I have never seen such excitement and tail wagging.  He hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise.  This one is the best.  It is well worth $10 for a dog who loves to play.  I get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys

I bought this canister vacuum about 2 months ago and I absolutely love it.
It is quiet and I told my husband I swear it picks up the dirt off the basement floor from our living room.  I love the automatic rewind cord.  The cord is very long and I don't have to look for a plug in each room I vacuum.  I have all hardwood floors and two cats and it really keeps the hair volume "in the bag".  The wands are sturdy metal. I have gone through about 3 vacuums in the past two years due to plastic parts breaking.  Thank you Electrolux for the quality build of this vacuum.  The only thing that irritates me is I can not keep the attachments attached to the bend in the wand.  I finally gave up and put them in a drawer since I seldom have to use them.  Spring and fall cleaning will be the only time more than likely.  I also wish the vacuum wands would stand by themselves when I have to leave the vacuum for one reason or another.  But it is still a 5 star even considering those two little things

Finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction!  I have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived.  The suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned.  The hepa filter means you really can't smell that you've been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change.  Also, who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner?  Hey, if you have to own one, wouldn't you prefer to have one that's easy on the eye?

The first time I used this waffle maker I was very disappointed and regretted the purchase. However, I gave it another chance. The second time I used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great. My husband said they were even better than the ones I used to make. To avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out, I lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it

This stone is very functional -- works well and goes from oven to table because of its beauty.  If you've never cooked on stone before, prepare to be amazed.  It's a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust.  I also use the stone for baking French fries and other stuff.  Just put the pan directly on the stone and your food will be done faster.  

With use your stone will discolor.  This happens with any stone.  You also should not wash any stone with soap.  Use hot water and a plastic scraper to clean.  This is the only All Clad product I have that I can't get the stainless to sparkle like new.  I think it's because I left it in the oven so much.  

The pizza cutter that comes with this is the best I've ever used.

Because of its size, this product is great as a bake-and-serve/occasional baking stone.  If you bake a ton, I suggest getting a larger stone and just leaving it the oven all the time

I see all the reviews agree - IT IS LOUD - but I love it.
I was able to sleep with it on HI speed - but can see how it would disturb some people.  It is very powerful - great for the bedroom - I often wake up hot or cold in the middle of the night - the four speeds & remote control are very convenient.

I only gave this product 4 stars because my daughter hasn't slept in it yet. But I set it up and it was super easy, almost one touch, set up. It is firm yet comfortable and the super soft fleece cover is awesome. It has moons and stars on it. The take down was 5 minutes if that. It's small enough to fit almost anywhere, and deep enough so that a toddler (my daughter is 2) will not roll off). Love it and I know I will be using it often.

This is the nicest pie dish I've ever seen. I dont even make pies but I got it to use for serving or to make casseroles or even to use for baking miscellaneous things. It's diameter is bigger than average and deeper too. The color is deep and rich. I got the cobalt. I will find a place to display this dish it's so pretty. Got one for my friend too.  She loves it as much as I do.  At 20.00 and free shipping you gotta try this ! Maybe I'll even try a PIE

Not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful, they also bake the most perfect pies I have ever put together. The crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky. I use Martha's pate brisee recipe, but with these pans it is foolproof! I have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches. Wonderful

This fan is an excellent value for its price.  It gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds.  Additionally, it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level.  I bought this fan because my old one had "died" in the middle of a hot summer.  This one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room.

The only reason that I did not give this fan a rating of 5 is because it has begun to hesitate when it swings to the right.  This has happened to other similar fans I have had, but not so soon after purchase.  If you're mechanical, you can probably correct the problem by yourself.

I do recommend this fan for anyone and any place.  Oh, did I say the remote is perfect???  Because I am handicapped, it saves me from getting up and down too often

This Swissmar fondue set is excellent. I love how stylish it is. I looked on Amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do:

- cheeses
- broths for meat
- chocolate

Flexibility is what I was looking for. The 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with, when done with that course, remove the ceramic bowl, pour the water out of the copper pot, and put in your broth. Although I haven't used it for chocolate yet, I'm sure it will work well for that. Using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat. Others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir. Of course if you're into the tradition of Swiss fondue cooking, the "thick" part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest!

The burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another I have used. Also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course. You will need to refill it between cheese and broth - of course make sure it's extinguished and cool before doing so. I used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store.

An excellent purchase - I am very happy with it.

After using my Roomba for a year and loving it, I decided to splurge and buy Scooba.  Wow!  I think I love it even more than my Roomba!  I turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it.  When I return, I have a gorgeous, shiny, clean-smelling floor.  Once a week, I wrap a damp washcloth around my Swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners--but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny ALL THE TIME.  Scooba is a miracle.

I did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box.  I had to prime the pump to get it going.  My only suggestion to iRobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming Scooba in the box instead of making people go to the iRobot website to troubleshoot.  Obviously, from reading the reviews, you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem.  Fortunately, that's the ONLY trouble I've ever had with it!  I've never had to prime again and it works flawlessly.  I'm very impressed with Scooba

I internet shopped for a week, reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made. I decided on this one based on my research and I am glad I did. I make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast, easy job. Ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly.

It is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power. I also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal, the pitcher is thick, solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless. I like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2, yes just 2 speeds. I find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used, they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons.

The fact that the Hamilton Beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the Moroccan Red is gorgeous.

The plastic top has no vents thereby producing rubbery, boiled tasting popcorn. Easily solved! I drilled about a dozen 1/8 inch holes in the top (bottom?) of the plastic bowl and voila! wonderful, crispy, crunchy popcorn.

I got this to replace my bulky turner that I got from the Dollar Store for $1.00.  For an extra $3 or so I got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me.  Also, the turner part looks plastic, but I guess it's silicone or something because it does not melt.  Also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat.  If washing by hand, its easily washable too!  I have both the blue and green, flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen.

I found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that I have ever bought. They hold an edge well and have a good balance.  The integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives. The only problem with the set is the steel hone. I find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife. That is the only detractor from the set

I must admit I'm really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's still too early as I've only had it for a month or so, and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it's been given.  

We have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home, and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week.  
Along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with, and so far there has been no problem.  I highly recommend this little guy, and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place.

One suggestion though. Wonder how long it'll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model. That way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode.

I had bought my first Fiestaware Cereal Bown sight unseen from Amazon.com, and I absolutely love the rich, cinnamon color of Cinnabar! 

The Cereal Bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal, soup, ice cream, and leftovers (smaller portions). It's microwaveable, too!

If you've never used Fiestaware before, this would be a great introduction to the line, especially if you have use for smaller soup/cereal bowls.

Ever since my curlers arrived I have been obsessed. I love the curls I get from the larger size. Just roll your hair when you wake up, do your make, eat breakfast, and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers (very painless) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials. I love this product!!!

My son, who lives in Washington, uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer. We live in California, but bought this fan to help vent our computer room, which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning. Because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled, it works GREAT. We plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down.

About a year ago I was looking for an espresso/cappuccino machine that would be both great in quality and easy to use. I also wanted it to look contemporary, to fit the style of other things in the house. On the other hand, I didn't want to spend a fortune for some expensive brands that run up to $12,000. At that moment I was lucky enough to order from Amazon Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite. That juicer impressed me so much, that I was happy to buy Breville's whatever - which happened to be Breville 800ESXL Die-Cast Espresso Machine. It is reasonably priced for style and quality and so far I, my husband and all our guests are happy with both espresso and cappuccino. I only wish I could do more than 2 cups at the same time. A year later, I still think it was a great buy and it works as well as ever

The product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch...there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area, which came out with Laundering. Other than that, the sheets are great. The Lace needs starch and ironing. The fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses, these two beds are put together to make a king bed. This product was a Christmas Gift and it was well received

I have always used the metal irons and was concerned about the nonstick. I was afraid the structure would create thicker pizzelles which are more cookie like versus light and wafer. The first ones came out and were sticking to the surface. I was disheartened thinking I am having the same problem as with the metal. I switched to nonstick to avoid this. Oh well, try again....and from that moment on was smooth sailing. I like the light indicator on this model, the easy clean up, storage design.....just everything.

Appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and WATCH OUT FOR THAT HOT PLATE BURNER! It's a bit tough on the fingers if you weren't expecting the carafe to be heated. Basically, this is a good coffeemaker; just not quite worth the price tag. For that amount of money, I expected something more

The English take their toast seriously, and while I don't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast, I lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at Williams-Sonoma for years.  About seven years ago, when the dollar was still strong versus the British pound, I bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the UK for about $100 less than the then-going US price.  While it's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots (not a big bread item in the UK), I solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them.  The toasting is even, and I actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up, which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled.  Unlike others, I do not unplug it after each use.  Never had a problem.  The crumb tray is terrific, and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess.  I've had the $100 Krups and Cuisinart models, which burned out within two years.  This one is made for restaurant use, and I expect it to last a lifetime.  Worth every penny, if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools

I really enjoy cooking in this pot.  It has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes.   The enamel surface is wonderful.  I love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family.   The only drawback is how heavy the pot is, but that doesn't change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen!

I just want to say I am not sure why the person who lost a piece of the product in her (Dawn Ulepich "Dawnski337" (Illinois)) haste is criticizing the company for a bad product. I have only had one problem ever with a Rival product and when I called the company, they immediately sent a new product out to take care of the problem even though it was not a product problem but rather a handling problem. I have found that they are a more than fair company and will take care of their customers. They probably would have even taken care of replacement of the plastic part (even though she lost it). It is not fair to penalize the store from which it was bought or the company that produced it because of her carelessness

We have had one of these grinders for over 15 years.  It was always the best and easiest to use.  Simple to change grind size, easy to fill and the side turn gives excellent leverage when grinding.  We broke the top and kept it in place with duct tape - not real pretty.  We were so happy to find the same grinder and now have two

This platter is much nicer than I was expecting, larger too. The glaze technique really looks beautiful on this piece and it will make a nice addition to my table setting. It is well made without being overly heavy

 It came well packaged and arrived only 3 days after I placed my order with the free shipping.

Thanks Amazon for having the companion pieces I can't seem to find in any department store

This has got to be the greatest little heater.  The only problem that I had was getting it to stop beeping when you change a setting.  Other than that , I really like the remote, and use this in my office at work.

We bought two Santas and two Pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at Amazon--they were the best gifts we gave, immediate hits with each couple, one in their late 50's, one in the mid-20's.  In each case the response was the same:  "It's like my childhood; they are going in the living room each season."

Vivid but soft, these are superb decorations.

I just love this garlic roaster, it roasts up to 3 med. size bulbs of garlic in less than 30 min. I like the idea of a mini roaster so I do not have to heat up my convection oven for such a small quanity of garlic. It is easy to clean and has great appeal in the kitchen. It has an automatic light and lets you know when roasting is complete. It cooks to perfection while lightly roasting the garlic ( top facing down)and I like to use a cloth to handle the hot garlic and squeeze them into my mashed potatoes, if you allow the garlic to cool off, the cloves firm up and are great eaten with a desert fork. I use spanish roja garlic in this roaster and it comes out perfect every time. I have used this machine for 5 months now and have since purchased another one as a gift

I was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker, but when it arrived it was just like brand new, including all original packing, perfect. I was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately, but again, it was quite strong in this regard, and froze the mixtures perfectly. Admittedly, doesn't make a huge amount, but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine MORE than makes up for it. And it's WAY quieter than the old fashioned freezers. ALSO it was half the price of a new one. BUY IT!

A great ice cream maker. No prefreezing bowls. It is loud so plan your ice cream making accordingly - you will not want to be in the same room as this thing when it is going unless you are already deaf LOL!

The price of this remanufactured unit along with the Amazon discount running at the time brought it to 125 with no shipping fees. Try to get that on Ebay!

This unit stays on my countertop at all times and attracts much interest from visitors. The ice cream is wonderful - I recommend Ben and Jerry's cookbook and a good ice cream scoop. Replacement parts can be found on the manufacturer's website and are reasonably priced.

As everyone else has indicated, programming isn't intuitive.  The opening was larger than necessary and my cats learned to stick their paws up inside the machine to steal more food within a few days.  We blocked off half of the food shute by using two very small screws and heavy duty plastic and the cats were no longer able to sneak food between feedings.  Prior to using this feeder, the cats would wake us up at the crack of dawn, crying for food.  Now, they associate feedings with the machine and leave us to sleep in peace!  Well worth the money for us!!

I collect both old and new Fiesta Ware and was thrilled to see the vibrant new Sunflower Yellow dinnerware.  The color is wonderful; much darker and more golden than the &quot;old&quot; yellow.  This bowl, particularly, is nice.  Because it is not too deep, your dinner guests can see your favorite dish; because it holds two quarts, there's plenty to serve.  Very lovely product that is easy to take care of

 I wanted a dual coffee/espresso maker thinking I would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence, but I was totally surprised how easy it is to use, and now it's lattes every day. Also, there was almost no learning curve-- my first cup (surprisingly, from what I've read elsewhere) was near perfect, and apparently it wasn't a fluke.

 If there is ANY drawback, it's only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe (but I'm sure a purist would scoff at such a notion).

 If I have one recommendation, it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe (or whatever it's called) to steam your milk. I'm not a physicist so I'm not sure why, but it does make a difference.

  In summation, this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice. (I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have to grind the beans, and it didn't include an intravenous unit)

I started to order replacement filters at $47.99 (too expensive) - but found the whole machine was on sale for only $49.99 - so I got 3 spare machines. I'll be looking for one with a washable filter before those need replacement.
By the way - they do remove dust and pollen and the like - and I'm happy with their performance.

It does a great job-it's easily put together, nothing spills, it's easily used-not much else to say

I really bought these measuring spoons to match the Michael Graves measuring cups that I was planning to buy, and I am sure glad that I did.  The are the easiest to use measuring spoons that I have ever used.  The unique handles seem just right.  You can use them equally well with either hand.  It seemed with the dipper type spoons that I previously used I was always changing hands, and the spoon was always in th wrong hand.  With these you can forget that.  You can tell the size of each of them just by looking at them, but I wish that they would have embossed the sizes all a little larger and painted them white.  Black on black is hard to see, especially when the numbers are so small

I got this Wok for Christmas as a gift. It is perfect. You are able to cook just about anything on this at a high heat without worrying that the food will stick to the bottom of the pan. It is easy to clean. 

So far I have cooked stir fries and potatoes with chorizo.

Each time the food came out perfect not undercooked or over cooked.

After the handle broke off the carafe that came with our Krups AromaControl (after about 2 years of use, perhaps several times a week), I found this one and ordered it.  My belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off, however I am perturbed that I had to go to the trouble of replacing it.  

One would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components.  I am not entirely sure, but it is possible that the plastic (ABS?) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured.  I searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem, which is at the same time comforting and annoying.

Upon receiving this carafe, I was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it.  I prefer a certain heft, and I assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made.  However, this has proved not to be the case; moreover, the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing.  Further, I think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe (inside) on this model.  The advantage of this is that the coffee pours better (a tighter stream, not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe), however, I it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult.  

In all, it is superior to the original, however I am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off.  I assume that they have fixed this problem in this model, however I cannot be sure of this.  I also must say that it is a tad over-priced, and that perhaps [...] might be a more reasonable price.  The only reason I did not get a new coffee maker is that the AromaControl works well and makes good coffee (I use Illy)

I was shopping in a gift store today and came across this Tovolo Tea Infuser and it is brillant!  If you don't use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain - this will spoil you.  It stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it doesn't drip on anything.  And the whole thing is dishwasher safe.  I paid more than $9.95 for mine too

My kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40.  My wife and I limit their exposure when we can.  An example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye.  Recently, they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle.  We figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers.  The ability to make jerky was a bonus for me.  I ordered another brand that I thought was going to do the job, but once it arrived I found the construction to be subpar and it was passive, requiring rotation of the trays.  I immediately sent it back to Amazon.  Thats when I ordered this Nesco unit.  It is powerful, and effective.  I have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers.  I have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them.  Order this and you can't go wrong

 I have never used any other dehydrator's and found this very simple to use, clean, store, and the price was great. Plus it makes my house smell great when I'm using it. So far I have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however, the instructions really makes it very easy and overall I'm finding it enjoyable to use.

Using a Chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing, and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for.  After the water is brought to a boil, it's important to wait for it to cool just slightly (about 30 seconds) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter, wait for them to drain, and then fill the pot with water.  Want more than a single cup of coffee?  You wait for your first pour to brew, and then fill the filter again.

Some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing:

1. Taste: I don't know how it does it, but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter. 

2. Cleanability: Users can keep all necessary components clean (anyone who's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn't there when you bought it understands this plight).  Oftentimes, the most aggressive criticism of the Chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir.  Some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse, which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot, but if you're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass, then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean.  The best thing I've found: a baby bottle cleaner.  It's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls, too.  Brilliant!

3. Electricity Free: As long as you can boil water, you can have coffee.

4. Mud/Sludge: French press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee.  Don't get me wrong: I think that's good (I use a French Press when I'm in the mood), but the cone on a Chemex doesn't allow that at all.

5. Style/Size: the Chemex coffee pot is a relic (designed in the 40s) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it's a wonderful, minimalist sight on any kitchen counter (and unlike electric coffee makers, easy to move if you need the space).

Some drawbacks any purchaser should consider:

1. Time: it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee.

2. Cones: you can't run over to Wal-Mart when you use the last filter; you need to find a specialty store or go online, which means you need to plan ahead.

3. Cold Coffee: no electric hot plate (thank god) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly.  You can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your Chemex can be warmed on the stovetop.  I think that's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor.  Just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee.

4. Learning Curve: It does take some time to get the grind right, the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue.

5. Cleanability: I know this is in the advantages column, as well, but it's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things.  To  submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff (which is a small pain) else it will get nasty over time

This set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces, however, once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware, you'll want to buy more. Over the years, I have spent hundreds of dollars on another well-known commercial cookware brand, but All-Clad is far superior. The stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for. The handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well-balanced, making them very easy to handle. They heat evenly and cook uniformly, even over low and medium heat. I am very pleased with All-Clad's performance on my radiant cooktop. I would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance. Well worth every penny

We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years.  They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.  

I have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below, but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together, not just by the handle.  Fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand.  

(They are made like hotel china, essentially.  Homer Laughlin is a hotel china company, in fact.  The first set of dishes I had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line.)

For a bigger cup for cafe au lait style, I can recommend the Fiestaware "jumbo cups."  We have a set of those in Sea Mist and use them for coffee, but also for heating soup in the microwave.  They are both great.  Never been disappointed with Fiestaware

I've owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp. It took me a little practice before I realized I was using it correctly, though. The directions could be better, and the machine doesn't provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening. _Cooks Illustrated_ magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models

I bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores.  I hated having to shop around and wish I would have seen a set like this.  Because I went from a queen bed to a king size - I had to buy new  pillows, mattress pad, comforter, sheets, etc.  I looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value - plus much easier to buy all at once.  I highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress.

I was not able to buy the king size set - but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift.

Cheers!

This toaster makes the best toast of any toaster I have ever owned and it looks GREAT!  I tossed my blue plastic Cuisinart, which at best made mediocre toast, and had that icky plastic worn out look.  This toaster is metal, sturdy and has a great retro look in today's colors.  Mine is red.  I also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer - a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen.  Amazon service has been great and with the $25 off I got some great buys

After 3 -1/2 years of pulling 4 to 8 shots of expresso per day, and steaming hundreds of gallons of delicious foamy milk, this little steam toy still works like new. Better than new, actually, because it has a better operator.  Good results require a bit of experimentation with the variables of different grinds and quantities of coffee and durations of extraction.  I've come home many times to discover that I'd left the electric switch on all day, but not to fear, the thing doesn't burn up, so far. On other occasions, I've overloaded the pump by letting the reservoir run dry and then adding water to try to resume extraction through a filter that had become clogged from the interruption of the flow of water.  The pump keeps going even with the output blocked down to a trickle. This will happen to you from time to time because you will neglect to refill the reservoir. When it happens, just start over with dry coffee. You will also need to buy a small diameter tamper - mine is 49mm.  

The expresso liquor always has crema and never tastes sour to me, even when using cheap brands of dark roast like Eight O Clock and Community Coffee.  Everything I've said about the brilliance of this machine is contingent, howver, on the coffee grinder. Without a good grinder, you might as well just make drip coffee. The secret good expresso, in my experience, is 25% expresso machine and 75% grinder. A good grinder is the Gaggia, which I bought from amazon for $175 with a discount, or the Rancillio Rocky, which I would have gotten in the first place had I understood the importance of an excellent grinder.  

This machine is small and light enough to take with you to the motel when you're on a road trip, and cheap enough to leave behind if you forget to put it in your car the next morning.  My next expresso machine will be much more expensive, but not because I'm trying to obtain a higher quality brew.  My only reasons for paying more are to get double shots and the solenoid valve, which will eliminate the spills of hot soupy grounds when emptying the porta-filter.  Also, when you get familiar with the operation of a machine, you'd like it to last so you don't have to learn a new set of techniques

This is our first juicer and we are have a great time juicing everything. We use it a lot with our smoothie maker.

It is designed well and is very easy to clean. It does drip a bit for a while from the spout but that isn't a problem at all.

We got this because we have a 2 year old and a 16 year old. We wanted to make it easy to give them great tasting sweets that are good for them. My 16 year old son loves apple juice and makes it all the time now-- no more soda in our house!

Helps with multi-cat households.  I had one of my cats die and the following month I adopted a rescue.  Naturally, all five of my cats had issues.  The Feliway Diffuser helped reduce their anxiety and fear.  It isn't a cure-all, but it was/is a help.

When DHL screwed up their delivery (an immensely crappy organization, but that's another story), he stepped in and sent another unit without delay.  Terrific guy, terrific price, terrific service

i've had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest.  Replaced it with a $20 MR. Coffee 4 cup from Walmart, which eventually, let water out the front, the back, the side, etc... creating a puddle just like the leaky braun.  Threw that out and went to a 12 cup Hamilton Beach that I had received as a gift.  What a POS... It had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also, the crap leaked as well, and when I lifted it, water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor.  After reading reviews on the Net and countless hours of searching for a good price, i was ready to buy the BUNN stainless steel.  I almost bought the Bodum electric Santos until I read that for some users, the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature.

Anyway, while at Target, I spent an hour looking at coffee makers, including the BUNN - which I really liked b/c it is made in the USA.  I decided to buy this one just to test it out.  I like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning (which the Bunn does not ahve) and a timer, which also the BUNN does not have.  The carafe is not bulky, and has a no-drip mouth.  Also, I have not seen any leaks so far, but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter.  Perhaps I should just remove the filter and not the basket.

The problem with most coffee makers is the steam.  After it condenses, the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body.  

Anyway, I also like the cool blue light in the front, and the coffee takes good - or as good as my braun which is what i've been used.  Overall, I don't think it's bad for 40 bucks.  If it develops a leak, I'll go buy the Bunn.  If that also sucks, I think i'll give up coffee for I've had enough trying to find a good, easy, no drip/leak (no punn intended) drip coffee maker.

The step stool, a gift for my daughter, works well as a step stool.  The problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool.  The frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws.  There was a hole in the box and the screws fell out, so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together

I used this skillet for the first time and it was great. I love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use. It cleaned quickly and required no seasoning. Also, its a really pretty skillet.

The sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates, shipping info and the skillet came quickly through Fed Ex. Very good customer service

A very nice blender... It crushes and purees, just about anything.. I've had it for three years now and it is still in great condition, and still very powerful... VERY LOUD! You might need ear protection as you use this.  I often turn it on, leave the room, do something else, and come back in when I think it is done!  I'm not kidding!:

great pot. I'm annoyed at having to press the "unlock" button everytime, the one that prevents accidental spills. the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes, I'm used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top. in hindsight I should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differences

I'm also really annoyed at the shipping, bought through amazon, it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in, which wasn't up for the rigors of shipping. but honestly I can't tell if the gaping crowbar-looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no

I was impressed when I received this case for my fiance's Christmas present.  As I began cramming the body pillow into it, I was happy to find a zipper at the opening.  All of the other body pillows I've had inevitably fall out of the case thus offering little support during the night when you're not awake to notice.  It's very thick and seems durable.  I recommend it

Eeks mice are great! Most catnip mice lose their flavor/smell/attraction for my cats pretty quickly, but my cats still play with an Eeks I've had for over a year. The one drawback is that they don't look too good after being played with (teeth marks, drool stains, ripped-off tails, etc), but cats don't care about that

For $19.99, you'll not find many knife sets. I paid that for one Kitchen Aid Santoku knife! This set includes a long slicer/utility knife, one large paring knife, and a 5 or 6" serrated knife. 

The knives consist of good steel, comfortable grips, and are well balanced. They are very sharp and sturdy. I couldn't find a better set for the price. I was looking for a decent utility/carving knife and a large paring knife when I found this set. 

I use mine as the "disposable" knives. For this price, you won't have to worry about beating up on them. And they sharpen up quickly, too. 
The red color is very festive. The grips feel like silicon, so they work when wet and greasy. And pleasantly squish when you grip hard.

If you are in the market for a fine, high level kitchen knife, these may not fit the bill. But if you are looking for good quality, inexpensive knives, you won't find better in this price range. I paid $19.99 Dec-200

we already owned the 7-inch santoku knife, purchased locally from a kitchen retailer, and loved it.  we were a little hesitant at first since we've only ever had cheaper knives, but as soon as we felt it in our hands and tried the knife we were sold.  still, the 7-inch is a little big for small jobs, so we decided to get this 4-inch paring knife.  i coupled a gift certificate with an amazon.com kitchen coupon promotion and was able to get the 4-inch paring knife and the 8-inch bread knife for a very good price.  this should pretty much complete our knife set-- from my experience these three knives are versatile enough for almost any job.

the 4-inch paring knife, specifically, is great for smaller jobs where the santoku would be awkward.  it's balanced perfectly, stays sharp, and since it's a single piece it cleans easily and you don't have to worry about the handle breaking.

all in all, great knife, and highly recommended

In our family we give a "mystery" kitchen item each year.  Everyone tries to guess what the item is used for.  This spreader really had the group stumped, someone finally came up with it on the third day, with some minor hints.  Since then my 11 year old has been using it to make sandwiches.  She says it works great, but you need to spread the peanut butter first.  This really is a gift for some one who has everything

Sango stoneware has been great for us for everyday use. Good feel with smooth surfaces including the bottom so it doesn't scratch. I've built up a whole collection of Sango Gold Dust after seeing it at Bed Bath and Beyond. Pick up items on sale, no need to pay regular price.

This set is a great addition to a more complete collection

I bought this to hold some of my "overflow" knives that would not fit into my knife block.  It has proven to be very handy.  

It seems well made, Im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot, but it is sturdy and nice looking.  It occupies about half of a drawer, which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non-sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it.

I have now switched its intended purpose slightly, insead of just holding the "overflow" from my counter top knife block, this now holds my most commonly used knives.  The "real" knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the "overflow" from this one

I've had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably. It is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued, Wusthof, Global and Henckels, knives organized, out of sight,protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger 'made mostly for show' blocks would. If you're looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time. If you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger. That's just my opinion. I could be wrong

Look.  I suck at using a normal iron.  But, after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on Dry Cleaners.

The results are pretty good.  As I have gotten better using it the results have gotten better.  Plus, there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others.  I just did a couple of long-sleeve dress shirts and the results were good.  Not perfect, but good.

As others have said, I wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with.  But, once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge isn't really a big deal.  More height clearance would be nice, though.

It won't be too long before it pays for itself.  And, now I have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled!  Plus, I'm pressing my golf shirts which typically didn't look that good after being washed, but were too expensive to get dry cleaned...

I also just ironed an undershirt just for fun.  Now THAT was an easy shirt to iron.  :

We had a press made by Singer that finally gave up the ghost after more than 10 years. After a several days of ironing clothes with mixed results & a lot of frustration, we researched presses on Amazon based on customer reviews. We decided on this press and have not been disappointed. The press is ready to use as soon as it's out of the box. Operation is simple & all but self-explanatory, and it heats up VERY quickly. It is a little smaller than our previous press, but not so small as to be a drawback. Clothes are ready in no time compared to ironing. The press comes with a water spray-bottle if you prefer not to use the steam feature. Definitely worth the money spent

The Krups XP 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now, with no problems to speak of.  We use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily, and each time it has been very good.  A notice I would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided.  The provided tamper is plastic, and can be wobbly, but I am very satisfied with the product

This whisk is very nice, and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand. One thing I hadn't foreseen, however, is actually pretty obvious. The silicone doesn't slide very well along most surfaces, so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction. It is exactly as advertised, though, and I am very happy to have it

I was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum.  Wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction.  It had some of the best section power I had seen in any vacuum.  So I bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities.  Its so light...about nine  pounds and easy to transport and store.  Its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button.  The bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum.  They are very easy to get at and change.  Its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors, along baseboards and on stairways.  Not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch.  I have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming.  This is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright.  My vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool.  Many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too.  I am glad I bought it and would recommend it.  Its the vacuum I would use most.  The biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done.  Push a button and the cord automatically rewinds.  Whats not to like about this vacuum.  Highly recommended

So far, so good.  I have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing.  I saw one reviewer that said it tore apart, and will update as time goes by.  So far I love them....well, she loves them.  Easy for her to pick up, when the ball is much larger than her mouth (holes in ball) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions, but highly recommend the blue one, as dogs see blue well (color blind)

I don't know about the other reviews that say this knives aren't stainless steel, the labels fall off, or the filet knife breaks, but what it's for sure in my case is that these knifes work great.  I don't go by fanciness nor brandy items... I WANT KNIVES THAT CUT nice and easy, and the Miracle Blade III are the best.  

It's true, if you love your things just follow what says in the instructions manual.  Don't dish wash your knives because in addition that they rust, they start to reduce their original sharpness.  Even more, any knife will reduce their original sharpness no matter what the manufacturer says.  Do not wash knives in the dishwasher or hand wash them with hot water.

All of my knives preserve their labels and looks like new, and I use them on a daily basis.  Once again, it's a matter of following instructions.  

My filet knife is in perfect condition.  Common sense: Don't do everything what the infomercial shows.  Don't bend the filet knife to verify that the guy on the infomercial's testimony is right.  This knife cuts beautifully without too much bending.  

Finally, I own this set of knives for two years and a half and they still cut as good as the first day I received them by mail.  I live in Colombia, South America, where this product is not too cheap, so I had to think several times before I decided to make the call.  Today, after two years and a half I don't regret of making that call, and I am very happy cooking with my Miracle Blade III knife set.  Furthermore, I do recommend this knife set to anyone.... JUST FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, that's all

I'm certainly glad to have this pointer.  You'd never know it is inexpensive, since it looks quite sleek (like a fountain pen, though  heavier, for sure) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance.  Pleasantly sensitive to  the  touch, it needs no fussing.  You'd have to have pretty specialized needs to want a  more expensive model

I could not resist trying this method of making espresso. You know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and I have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive Bialetti.  The first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me....the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother I used to have.  There are a few tricks with the frother(1% milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile').  The milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon, pump it quickly and serve.  Regarding the espresso maker itself....just don't add any more water than to that line..and oh don't open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top.  To know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done....very quick and yummm

My Boxers just love the little balls.  They like digging them out of the container even though it did not take very long after they got the hang of it.  They carry the balls and container all over the house and yard.  It has held up very well.  We have had this over a year now, and I only had to stich up maybe 2 of the balls once each.  Squeekers still work great - haven't needed to replace yet.  Very happy with this toy

This is absolutely, hands down, the best toy we've gotten for our dogs. We own three sets of these in varying sizes. Because the balls are plush, they will wear out- this is not for your destructive chewers. Our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day. Before leaving for work, pop a couple of treats inside and you're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks.

This is one of my most used knives in the kitchen. It's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons. You'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control, and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily. 

The blade keeps its edge for a long time, but eventually you will have to sharpen it. I invested in a good coarse stone, a good 1000 grit water stone, and the $5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant. Good stones are expensive though. I think it's worth it for such a fine knife

2)  Clear plastic, allows full view of soap level
3)  Long spout allows easy access to sink.  No counter spills!
4)  Smooth pumping action - no clogs
5)  Pump goes all the way to the bottom - "sucks" it all out!
6)  Wide opening makes it easy to transfer soap from a large   
    bottle.

The bad (Aesthetics):

1)  Not beautiful (not horribly ugly either)
2)  No choice of color.  Would have preferred white to match 
    kitchen appliances.

Verdict:

Function wins out over aesthetics.  Highly recommended

You can't go wrong with this knife.  I use it almost as much as I use my 8 inch chef's knife.  It holds an edge well, feels light in your hand, and has perfect ballance.

This knife has made me eat more vegetables, just because it's so much fun to chop carrots.  I was a little concerned with the handle at first, but it's very comfortable, and isn't slick at all, even in soapy water.  I also worried that maybe I should have gotten the bigger version of this knife.  Again, my fears were unfounded, as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation.  You can't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job... but if you've ever had that feeling, you already know how you'll feel using a Global.  When I slice carrots for snacks, they come out as perfect, translucent discs.  Any vegetable I've cut has been a joy

I loved my 8 inch Global chef knife so much I ordered this veggie knife.  Oh wow, this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies.  It also fits in your hand extremely well. If you are going to cut up a potato, it is hard to beat the chef's knife.  However, for cutting up a tomato, carrot, etc. this thing is the best tool I have ever used.  Just wonderful

The pots and pans were delivered very quickly to my residence.  The items were well packaged. Since we just moved into our apartment, we began using them.  The pots and pans had sturdy construction and was relatively easy to clean.  The only drawback would be the lid handles.  Those became very hot to the touch, and you would need a hand towel or an oven mitt to handle it.  (On a side note, The lid handles are clear glass, so that is definitely a plus!)

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the purchase.  They were under $100.00 for the set, so we are happy with it.

Although I did not hear of the Pinzon brand before, I was surprised with the quality.  I even purchased a oven roaster w/rack from Pinzon as well

As I tend to "nurse" a cup of tea at the office for a while, I decided to purchase this product this after looking around for a GOOD desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug.  Such a product just doesn't seem to exist; check the Amazon customer ratings.  I  had one a number of years ago, and it was lousy (had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap, but no one has!)

I purchased this mug just about a month ago.  It's so good, I had to share the secret, and even if an improved electric warmer DID exist, I don't think I'd bother with its cord and risks given how good this is.  I'm sorry to see, though, that it's no longer available through Amazon (perhaps elsewhere on the Web?).  

I can make a mug of tea (a generous 20 oz) around 10a.m., and even by mid to late afternoon, 4 or 5p.m., it's still warm enough to enjoy.  And that's after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough to drink!  Indeed, if there's a "fault" with it, it's almost TOO efficient if you use boiling water for the tea and want to take a sip right after you've finished brewing!  

Though called a "travel" mug, it won't fit into any auto cupholder I've seen.  It's really perfect for a desk.  It's relatively low (taller than a typical ceramic mug, though), the base is nice and wide, and there's a ring of rubber/silicone type material (which has not scuffed anything on my desk) around the edge of the bottom that really is non-slip; between these features it seems quite stable.  The removable black plastic top (friction secured with the typical silicone type O ring around the edge) allows you to move the opening anywhere you want, to use left or right handed.  There's a simple slide to open/close the drinking aperature.  The interior is also stainless steel, so no plastic taste.  Even with boiling water inside, the outside remains virtually at room temperature (as you'd expect, given its thermal efficiency).

My only complaint (minor) is that it is NOT dishwasher safe (and I haven't tested it!), but it's easy to hand wash.  With the wide mouth, you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom.

I have several inexpensive auto "insulated" mugs (key word here, I think, is "inexpensive"), that are truly underwhelming, so initially I didn't have high expectations for this, but it really is fantastic.  If you want a hot beverage to keep for several hours on your desk, this is for you!  No regrets

I've changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years. I cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself. That said, I still have reasonable water pressure and here's the amazing thing, my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it. Who knew that for all my life, it was the water, not my hair. My skin is not as dried out...if I could work out the little glitches, it would be perfect. I own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it's fab for the price!

I've owned a Littermaid Mega for about 5 years and I really wish I had been able to buy this stand sooner. We have two cats and we're terribly lazy. We've had this stand for a few months and it works as described. It has drastically reduced the smell and the need to clean the box. WE LOVE THIS STAND and it has made life a lot more bearable when it comes to the litter box.

Our old Littermaid just died on us and we went to replace it with a new Littermaid Elite but the stand isn't large enough. The newer Elite model is much longer than this stand and it will hang off the back and over the sides. We love that stand more than we want the newer Littermaid Elite and we are getting a great deal on the old style of the Littermaid Mega from Amazon. I would just be aware, before buying this, that it only fits the old style of Littermaids. That being said, if you're handy with power tools and woodwork than you might be able to modify it...it is a simple design.

I have not tried to program the timer yet, but as a heater, this is one of the nicest I have had.   Compact, yet it puts out a nice even heat.  It is save in that the unit itself doesn't get red hot.   The ad says factory reconditioned yet it came in a new box and looks like new.   A super deal for auxiliary heating.   I use it to warm the livingroom to keep oil consumption down, which it seems to have done so far, without too big an increase in the electric bill

I just tried this out for the first time, and I was impressed.  It baked evenly and nicely.  Best of all, the cake came right out.  I simply sprayed it lightly with non-stick spray, and baked.  Due the flexibility of this product, you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability.  I will be buying more from this line

This could well be the perfect dog toy, especially if your dog is a Queensland Heeler with a knack for destroying plastic Frisbees, tennis balls, etc. in seconds flat.  I've had one for a couple of weeks now and, aside from some dirt spots, it looks new.  It is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not-so-tender mercies of my dog's attention. This disc is not only very durable, it actually flies really well.  As something of a flying-disc connoisseur, I can't help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries.  Plus, it floats.  Perfect!

This is an incredibly beautiful knife, with an excellent weight.  Well-balanced.  The damascus steel is just so nice.  My husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative.  This is our third expensive kitchen knife and I would say that in terms of general use--meat to vegetables--this is my second favorite, with my large, 8" Henckel being my best knife.  The Shun is much nicer than the Wusthof Prix II, which sports the comparable Santoku shape.  My complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle, making this a much better knife for filleting motions, of which I do few.  It's marketed toward general chopping and slicing, but I find that slant makes my cuts less precise.  It's still my husband's favorite, but since I'm the one who does the majority of the cooking, I'd still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands.  But it's a real marvel to behold and I love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel

Here I have a refurbished Palinato X3; textured, very hardy stainless; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws, -170 to start (6 mo warranty). 

But let me correct one point made in these reviews, the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic, a rather new trend that works quite well, the steam nob as well seems to be this material. 

All around this is quite an improvement on the X1: more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the X1. Cups warm quicker also. 

It also seems to handle ground coffee a little better. Still it's important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder, and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming, fat content just makes more fat, not true foamed milk.

This product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic.  Amazingly, it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer (just a thin cardboard box with no padding).  The only real gripe I have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper.  The hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side.  This does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation, but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities - one of the reasons why I picked this particular product in the first place.  If it were not for the flawed lid, I would have given this product a five-star rating.

Perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who don't like their food all running together on your plate.  Good for snacks like pudding and jello.  Also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side ~ nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing.  Plus it won't take up alot of space on your table.  This is a very nice color

I have had this unit for 8 months and haven't had any problems.  It has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked.  I have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand, and I have very small hands.  Some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin

I was looking for an &quot;offset serrated knife&quot; as mentioned by Bourdain, and this fits the bill. Outstanding veggie slicer and all-around food prep instrument. Even over-ripe tomatoes, the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding, are no match for it. Besides the small and handy size, the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles. When it finally begins to dull, several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights

I purchased these sheets together with the Pike Street 800 thread count sheet set as they were being offered as a combo special, made on the page if you wanted to order the 800 thread count sheets, which I did, and I cannot tell you how thrilled I am with both sets of sheets. If you can still get them both together(amazing price)you should, you will not be disappointed at all. They are both very well made & wonderful to sleep on. I have an 18" thick mattress and they fit perfectly. My husband and I love good quality sheets & and we both highly recommend these. The few wrinkles that you may find after they come out of the dryer should in no way affect your decision to buy these wonderful sheets and miss out on this sheer elegance. I mean after all, you deserve it, you are worth it, so go for it. For my husband and I, an incredible nights sleep in total comfort.....PRICELESS

The Wonder Washer appears cheaply made, but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine. It augments my regular washer nicely, washing small loads and delicate items well. On the debit side, the washer's design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket; a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items. The manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly

We tried littermaid and still use it in our motor home, but we absolutly LOVE the cat genie for our 2 spoiled and large cats. We would not only buy it again, we're getting one for my sister for her birthday, and recomending it to everyone we know with cats. We've been using it for the past 5 months and it has clogged twice. [an easy clean-up and fix]  Much less hassle than the litter maid and no smell or dealing with overflowing cartridges. [ or my DH's attempts to 'modify' the littermaid so it will hold more, or use bags or boxes, etc... which never work and make a smelly MESS!!] Every now and then the 'soap box' will jiggle loose and might need a tap to re-seat it, but you get a beep to warn you.
Now if they would only make a smaller cat genie for the rv

This is the most amazing knife I have ever owned!  I ve purchased Henckles Twinstars, Sabatier;which is pure junk!  Out of all the knives Ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives. I enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives.  I have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all Global this is quite a bold move as I consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where I must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know I do not want to live without.  I simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and Henckles Twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a Pandora's box of spending.  It actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other.  I must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the "EXCALIBER of knives.

I had to replace a heart waffle maker as my grand kids love Nana's heart waffles and I had taken it to the beach and left it there.  They know Nana's heart waffles are the best as they come from her heart.  I love this one even more than the last.  It has great controls that make the perfect waffle.  Clean up is a breeze and it is cute!

Over the years I've tried a good dozen humidifiers.  Worries about bacteria, difficulty in filling up, and difficulty in operation led me to trash them all.

I now have two U7142 Himidifiers.  The control system is extraordinary; you can set desired humidity, fan speed, and time to run.  There is  preheater(to 40C) that helps kill the bad stuff and use of silver(don't understand it but assume it works.) to kill more bad stuff.

Liked the first so much I bought a second

I bought this stone to detail the edge of the new set of Calphalon forged kitchen knives that I recently purchased. I have used oriental water stones in the past, and this stone is as good as any I have used. With just a few strokes, it will turn a Calphalon, Henckles, or Wusthof into a Gillette. With this stone and a good steel, your knives will last far beyond your years

My roommate and I use this toaster daily and I've never had problems with it. The material is light but very sturdy.  I actually dropped it down my stairs when I moved and it still looks and works great. I love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions. Delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal. I plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but I suspect that won't happen for quite a while.

We received the Zephyr as a wedding gift. Ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo. The handle on ours is brass instead of chrome. It heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup-o-noodle.   Much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there. My wife and I are very pleased with this tea kettle

We have had this unit for 6 months and we really enjoyed it.  It makes a great cup of coffee, it is easy to use and we do not understand why some other reviews complain.

Then - without any warning it stopped working.  I called Hamilton Beach and they are sending a free replacement, no questions asked.  The unit has a "hassle free" 3 year warranty and it really was a snap.

We are glad we bought this unit and are happy with how Hamilton Beach stands behind their products

The filter model I have, 18150, requires two of these with no foam spacers.  Two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter I purchased once previously.  However, I'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall, maybe slightly less.  The cover still goes on, but not as far down as it should.
As for filtering, I estimate that it filters the same as the previous.  The "permanence" of this filter makes me wonder why I've been replacing the previous style, since I can see no difference in the filter material

In Anthoney Bourdain's book "Kitchen Confidential" he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs don't use Henkle or Wustoff knives, they use Global.  Cat Cora of "American Iron Chef" also uses Global knives.  I needed a good knife in my kitchen so I decided to check out Global as well.

First of all, it's incredibly light.  If I'm chopping a LOT of onions for a french onion soup or making a big batch of mirepoix for some beef stock I notice that lightness. 

Then there's the balance.  See that notch where the blade meets the handle?  Pick the knife up by that notch and it balanced exactly level.  Try that with a standard knife and you'll see how handle heavy they are.

Finaly, the edge.  These knives are insanely sharp.  They cut like a dream.  I just went to a knife sharpening clinic by Wustoff and they suggest honeing your knife with 5 or 6 stroks on a steel before every meal that you cook.  I've found that this keeps the edge razor sharp.  However, you should realize that the edge on these knives is at 15 degrees, not 20 degrees.  So adjust the angle you use to hone the edge.

Overall, it's an amazing knife.  Take care of it and it will serve you as a professional quality tool for a long time

I bought the fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living in Arizona.  The butter sold there is packaged in shorter, wider, and higher sized sticks.  So, it didn't fit into the butter dish unless I trimmed it!!  Couldn't figure it out, why would they make a butter dish that a stick of butter won't fit into??!!  So....have just moved to the Houston area, and guess what, the butter here is sized just right for the dish.  Maybe they need to make two different sizes for west and east coast butter??  Crazy!  Nice butter dish, though

I bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet, which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz.  It does a reasonable job cleaning, transforming my carpet from "Does she ever vacuum?" to "Oh, she must have vacuumed yesterday".  It doesn't get all the fuzz and crumbs, but it does what I'd expect from a sweeper.  It is also much lighter than my vacuum, so I'm much more likely to use it.

My three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too.  She insists on sweeping her own room (I won't complain).  

The main thing I've learned is that, because the handle slides together, it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head.  This means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle, the sweeper will probably fall off, so pick it up near the sweeper.  (It stays together fine when actually sweeping.

I ordered two of these great Fiesta handled carafes in black.  I plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces.  Black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so I had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase.  I have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces.  I was not happy when I received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips (where the white under the glaze shows through) as well as scratches in the glaze (which I have never seen before and can't imagine what happened to put them there).  In my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds.  I love the pieces, I'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish. I also received a black covered butter which was blemish free

I absolutely love the new Scarlet color by Fiestaware.  Mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice -- sometimes I think those Fragile stickers result in box abuse!

I was surprised at how small it was, but it did say 6" and 6" it is.  You won't bake a pie in it (unless you make individual ones) but it will be great for dips and sauces

I love the large size of these tumblers, as I can get a whole can of pop with ice in them.  The thermal feature works good, the ice lasts longer, and they don't sweat, so I don't need coasters under them.  They are colorful, so each guest can have their own color, no mix ups. They fit on the top rack of my dishwasher, and they don't seem to be marked or scratched yet. After seeing mine, my daughter-in-law got some, as did two sets of my friends.  I am so glad to have found them!

Just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket.  It is rice we have prepared numerous times in another (cheaper) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop.  The rice that came out of the Zojirushi was absolutely perfect!  As good as any I have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to China.  I was astounded.  None of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker, just perfect plump, fragrant rice.  The countertop stayed clean as well, didn't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker.  Clean up of the cooker was easy.  Top notch, excellent product.  You can't make better rice than what this thing produces

These colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys. They are treated with catnip, but to be honest, I don't think my cat knows the difference. Unlike their Zanies Furry Mice counterparts, Zanies Rainbow Mice also rattle, since they have tiny pebbles inside them. A word of caution about this though: the pebbles are encased inside a semi-rigid plastic cartridge (which makes up the body of the mouse). The furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued. After my cat played with one of the mice, the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed. Since there are pebbles inside, unsupervised play might not be very safe. It's best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them. Other than that, these are great toys and the price/quantity/quality ratio is pretty good. Quantity is important here, because, due to their small size, most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture. Since you get 60 mice in this package, you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action. In the long run, it's a lot cheaper than buying them individually

This is a high quality pan, with a nice heavy weight to it - not at all flimsy. I wanted to get one like my mom's, and this turned out to be less expensive, but a much better quality and heavier weight. I bought 2 of these, along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of Amazon's 4 for 3 promotion, and it only came to about $30! That is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality. I would absolutely recommend these

i consider myself a space heater pro.  i have tried so many heaters and only this one, this year, has been worthy of a review.  BUY THIS HEATER.  i love it so much that i bought two more when i loaned my original to my sister:)

it is great.  the tower has two heat options that are fantastic.  it heats the whole room if you need it to.

a must have for chilly nights

I think I'm a little crazy for buying this. I just had to find out if the copper-core was really better than an aluminum one. It is, but not by that much. You can buy a pan from Cuisinart's Multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price.

That being said, this thing is very well designed. The rolled-lip is useful for pouring. The radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there (a problem with most pans). The handle stays cool and is well designed. Overall, this is the best 2-quart saute pan money can buy. Is it worth it? That's up to you

I love this filter! It keeps the water pristine and more importantly it is easy to assemble and clean thanks to the included double tap valves and media basket. 

Silence was a key buying point for me as it was purchased for an aquarium in my bedroom. This filter is absolutely silent. So silent that I can now hear the hum of my fluorescent aquarium lights

If you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner, then you will love this one.  I bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large (and heavy) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair.  Because of the small bagless chamber, you have to empty it frequently, so I wouldn't count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner.  I wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs, specifically to pick up pet hair, and this vacuum exceeded my expectations.  I tried the Shark, a similar model made by Fantom, and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does (stay away from the Fantom cordless - by far the worst!!).  I don't think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did.  Overall, this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean-ups or to maintain pet-hair free area rugs.  

One suggestion - use the carpet setting even on bare floors.  The brushes are high enough so they won't scratch bare floors, but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush. I found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless I used the carpet setting.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying.

I'm very happy with this mixer. It arrived in pristine condition, even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn.  The machine does what I ask of it with no glitches or complaints.  I bought it mainly for bread making, and after a certain amount of practice, I'm turning out great products.  I also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients, so I think I will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard.  

My only gripe is not with the machine, but probably with Amazon because I did not get the model that was pictured.  I got the HD.  I have researched as much as I can, and the machine I received is probably identical to the one I thought I was getting, but I just don't understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying.  Seems kind of elementary to me

My husband and I took over a house with 2 kitchens, and I wanted to decorate the smaller one in cream an black.  I fell in love with these, but never received them... they were sent to the wrong address and after the 2nd time, Amazon wouldn't send them again and I gave up.

I went ahead and gave them 5 stars 'cause I was at a freinds house and she had these dishes.  They were really heavy and the print was consistent.  I'm so jealous

It is a very pretty maker, and coffee is made under perfect conditions.  The price is good through Amazon, just make sure you use suggested filters, the other DO NOT work... (learned from experience).

If premium coffee is your "thing" and pretty is a bonus,  this maker is the answer

Its the perfect size to make pancakes, eggs and bacon! We used it to make grilled cheese, and they came out perfect! This would be great for singles, college students, and anyone who likes great things in small packages

For many years I had a Presto pressure cooker, but when the sealing ring didn't work a few years back I tossed it out thinking I could never get a replacement ring.  I missed having that pot.  I'm glad to have one once again.  Stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one, but tonight will be spare ribs.  The new pot is nothing like my 30 year old one.  It works the same in the end, though.  I would have opted for the aluminum as that was what I had, but my husband bought the stainless steel.  I don't think it makes a difference for the price, except in appearance

When I first saw this dehumidifier I couldn't stop laughing. This little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed? I figured that something was better than nothing until I could buy a better(bigger) dehumidifier. I hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little-bitty sucked up an inch of water...in one night!!! Now I am so confident that this will do the job I will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem. The free shipping was a great plus as well!!

We have an Aussie/Healer mix (we think...she was a foundling) with a thick, soft coat. I've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at $60 to $75 a pop so last summer I decided to try it myself with this clipper kit.  To make a long story short, she didn't turn out so bad! (Well, the neighbors didn't laugh, anyway!) It took me a while to get the hang of it--I finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers--but she didn't complain and I had a "cool" dog for much less $$$ than a pro cut.  The best part was I could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back.  No report as yet how long the blades last, but I'm already money ahead even if I must replace them next year

I absolutely love this decanter.  I have had two others--one very expensive, one inexpensive, both without handles.  While very elegant, they were a nightmare to clean and pour.  They both broke...well, good riddance!  This is the best decanter, large surface area, angled mouth, and indespensable handle.  

I have received compliments EVERY time I use it while entertaining.  I am ordering several more for gifts.  I am positive they will please all who receive them.

Perfect

I have been using a Chemex 10-cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life. I am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee!

There is a downside to this coffee maker: it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to, and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently. The first time I tried to use mine, I had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever! The big time consumers: you have to boil your water separately (you do have a water kettle right?) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the Chemex. This means that while the coffee is brewing, you are pouring, or watching, or giving the filter area a bit of a stir.

Now the up side: you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee. I use filtered water, freshly ground home roasted beans, and this Chemex to produce the finest coffee I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. And this coffee is a pleasure! In fact, I've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide. 

Another up side: clean up means swishing the Chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain. You can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary. A brief swish is really all it takes to get your Chemex looking factory new. Try that with your electric drip machine! Ha! That thing will NEVER look brand new!

Oh, here's a final upside: this Chemex brews the best coffee you'll ever drink, and it costs less than just about anything. You are probably already spending more money than this every month at Starbucks! 

Go ahead and buy yourself one of these. If necessary, wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee. Better yet, wake up 20 minutes earlier. And when your coffee is ready, instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door, sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes. You deserve it!

UPDATE: 
It's been a year now and I still love this Chemex. However, over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use. Nothing I tried got it clean, but something my wife tried did: a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing.
Now my Chemex looks brand new

My cat asked me to submit the following review:

"Hi, my name is Obadiah, and I am N Lim's cat. He has been feeding me Purina Cat Chow Indoor formula for over a year. I must say that this is excellent cat food and tastes good. Before Purina came out with the Indoor formula, I was getting the regular Purina Cat Chow and always had an overweight problem. Weighing over 15 lbs, I never went outside and slept most of the day. This sedentary lifestyle caused some concern with my veterinarian, who said I should be down to about 12 lbs. Then, I started on the indoor formula and lost those three pounds. I am lighter on my paws and can still be just as lazy as I want to be.

I bought this Lightwedge for my daughter who is 7. I found out that after I put her to bed, she could not go to sleep right away. She would use a flashlight to do little reading. Well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light. It shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes. My only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes. I ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks. They should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes. But it does do the job

I got excited about 5min after opening the box... most people laugh at the idea, but this thing is perfect for me... i live in a decent sized apartment and always have unexpected guests... all i did was set the schedule to to the thing on twice a week while at work... lets see how that runs... just for fun, as soon as i got it, i plugged thehomebase charger in, took the roomba to the opposite end of my apartment in another room... pushed the "find home" buttons and within 5 min, it was charging it self.... right now i have it running around the apt just to watch it.. its entertaining, circling around chair legs before its done going under furniture, stopping at lint and going over it again it till it gets picked up... i dont know what to say... ive had the thing for 5 hours, and im loving it... whenever it goes over wires, it backs up and tries something else... and the thing sounds like a remote control car... maybe not even that loud... i was expecting it to sound like a full blown vacumm.. not the case at all.... just as a test i put a very thin cord about 6 inches long in its path to see what would happen... the thing tries everything to get it from being stuck, then if it cant get it out.. it stops and makes little "game over" type sound effects... this thing is good... anyone who sees what its doing to my apt will wind up getting it.   I will update this if anything changes.   hope you get the same results

PROS: Works well. Heats fast, auto-shutoff feature and visible water level are nice.
CONS: Putting kettle on base requires lining up 3 slots which takes a little extra care and might result in damage to contacts if you're not careful.

My dog is simply crazy about these treats. But what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. Since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. In additon to that, since these treats are all natural, they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats, making them extra healthy. 

The price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can't beat the quality.

This lamp went together with no problem. The pieces fit tightly and the lamp stands perfectly upright. It is more brownish than reddish. But I believe that it can go with many colors, especially pastels. The design, color and simplicity make this a very classy lamp. The slate shade is gorgeous and much tougher than I thought. This lamp, as most lamps, is not made for grabbing and moving too much. Put it where you want it and enjoy it's beauty! Buying this lamp is a win-win situation

I normally don't write reviews... but after owning several toasters in the past, and being very disappointed, I just had to write about this one.  I owned an old Toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years.  It never did brown evenly, but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke.  Got my money's worth.  
I have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions, amazon, and others... and many people haven't been very happy with toasters they have bought costing nearly $300.00 (dualit).  Toastmaster, GE, Rival, Dualit, most Kitchenaid and Sunbeam models were poorly rated.  I found one review on this Sunbeam (this is their top of the line model, the chrome and black model costs more, but currently not in production.) and the person really really liked it.  So I ordered this from Amazon directly, this was the VERY lowest price I could find.  Order something else so as to get their free shipping!!! (over $25.00)
So what happened when I got it.
Got the toaster... plugged it in... dropped two slices of bread in, and excitedly waited for my toast.  A few minutes passed..... then.. POP!  its done... or so I thought.  When the toast came out... it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted.  This goes for BOTH slices.  Right then and there I was ready to send this thing back.  Well.... had been busy that week and continued using it day after day...  Each day was as disappointing as the first..... THEN.... after a little over a week.... The bread started toasting... uh.. well PERFECTLY!!!  After owning this for nearly 4 months... it still browns evenly on BOTH sides of each piece of bread, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  I don't know why it started working right... wouldn't think that it would need to be "broken in" to work right.  I am so glad that I didn't send this back right after the first several toastings.... Procrastinating worked out in my best interest, for the first time.  I have not tried Bagels in this... don't like bagels.... but it does well for what I bought it for.  I think the style is rather funky, but many people have liked its looks.  If this toaster works for you as good as it has for me... I think you will like it!!!  If it doesn't work well right out of the box.... you might give it a few days.... maybe the toast fairy will bless you too.

The distribution of heat in this pan is super!Great for gravies and sauces. I have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking. Stir frying can reduce fats and is usually a pretty healthy way to eat a wide variety of veggies and other delightful ingredients. I even use it to pop brown rice or basmati rice. Ever tried hot puffed rice? Sometimes I eat it just like pop corn but often just for a different way of serving rice. This pan is deep enough with or without the lid to keep it from popping out of the pan (depending how much you start with). It is also useful to cook or finish foods in the oven up to 500 degrees. And it is KitchenAid. I expect it to outlast me

This is the only toy that she will play with for hours on end and gets excited when she see it. Definitely worth buying, it gives great excercise. We sometimes use it as a distraction when our dog gets anxious

I purchased this for a betta fish, which was a gift for my cats.  This model was perfect because the lid screws on, which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish.  There is a small hole at the top, so you don't have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish.  The "aqua gems" cover the bottom, but I added some gravel for additional covering.  Also, the aqua gems are light, and you lose some when changing the water, so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually.  The one negative I found is that the light is basically useless.  It illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied.  I did look at PetSmart for additional oxygen stones, but they don't sell them.  Not sure if those are really necessary, though

I am very pleased with my new salad spinner. It can hold a large amount of salad, which means I do not have to reload and do the work over and over. The mechanism is easy to use and works smoothly. I am also able to soak the salad in icewater in it, and then drain it and spin, all in the same piece of equipment.

It's a towel.  Not too much to say, for more information, read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.

Very good quality, resiliant, color hasn't faded, despite being used to dry me off after falling into a creek, being used as padding for my elbow at the firing range, and wiping up spilled cleaning chemicals.  Tough little bugger

When I pick up the brush both my dogs fight to be first.  My Chow has long hair that is always in knots on her backside.  This brush just plowed right through them and she never even seem to notice.  My Malamute thinks I have nothing better to do than use it on her.  It completely got rid of the odors.  My dogs rate it their second favorite thing in the house just under their food.  The most amazing thing was I had to buy a second brush as I found by accident that it works for me too.  I have very long hair that gets knotted very easy.  In a hurry one day I picked up their brush and in seconds the knot was gone.  No pulling no ripping of hair.  If you have the same trouble I suggest you give it a try.  Would be Super for kids

I recieved this from my husband after he got it as a gift at a Secret Santa Party. It is a really beautiful set and all the candles and accents matched what was advertized. I set it up in my office (in a different pattern from what was shown) and it really adds a nice touch, especially with its blend of soothing smells.

My only complaint is that one of the glass stones was broken in half and the other half could not be found- it probably slipped through the quality control department at the factory. But it had plenty of others to compensate, so it's not a big deal.

I highly recommend this product, especially if you like to "customize" and design your centerpieces rather than have them "pre-assembled.

Superior product, great tasting expresso (rivals Starbucks), and very reliable.  I have owned the Granos for about 6 months and have found it to be a pleasure.  It is easy to use and makes a top quality cup of expresso.  The style of the unit is also unique and has generated much conversation with house guests.  If you want a reliable expresso machine that makes a great straight shot or latte, I can't recommend the Granos more highly. I plan to buy another for my office

I bought the machine about 2 weeks ago and it took me about 5 min to read the instructions and use the machine. Sorry, but one would have to be an idiot not to understand how to use it. I love its versatility,e.g. espresso coffee or pods, regular water or add bottle (for those whose tap water is bad (comes with an adapter)), froth maker for capuccino or steam water for tea. It sure will draw WOWs from your friends. As long as you remember to run a cup of water through before each time you use it, your espresso should be the perfect temperature. Took me some time to realize why it was lukewarm. The only bad thing (why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars) I have to say about the Granos is that in order to remove the portafilter, i.e the part with the handle holding the coffee, you have to use force. But maybe after a few months it will loosen up a bit and things will be easier. All in all I am completely satisfied with its user-friendliness, crema, temperature, and versatility.

These bowls have been in my home for a few years now.  We have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave.  They are nice looking and very functional.  When we needed another bowl when one broke, we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl

This is a great pan.  Aside from the fact that it is easily the best non-stick on the market (and I have used Anolon, Calphalon and Scanpan), what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution.  There are no hot spots, not even the center.  When sauteing the food colours evenly (even when the pan is a little overcrowded); when stewing, you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food, demonstrating how even the heat distribution is.  This pan also makes a fine risotto.

Oh, and did I mention its non-stick is simply the best.  Clean up is a breeze.  Nothing sticks.  Even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water.  The surface on Swiss Diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan!  

Swiss Diamond is the KING of non-stick, as not only is their surface No. 1, but the quality of their pans is second to none.  I own two Swiss Diamond pieces, I plan to buy more, and I couldn't recommend these pans more highly.  This is the pan I reach for the most

I got two of these. One for me and my wife and one for my sons room.
We live in NYC (Queens) and its two floors down to laundry room. The house is old and stairs are very steep, no building codes back in 1901.
Carrying a basket down stunk, door ways are narrow in my house so always jammed my fingers. This is great, roll it down & up stairs no jammed fingers. If anything I would prefer a taller handle. I am 5'10" and its just a bit to low. For my wife its perfect height.

Gave it a one star ding do to shipping costs. MAN was almost as much as the two hampers cost to buy. Its shipped from Target, but Target doesn't carry them in store, only on-line. And I have seen these in stores for more than twice the price here. So it's about even.
Good hamper, takes up minimal space and great for you with narrow doorways and steep stairs

I recently purchased this set after spending several weeks trying to decide which set was right for me.  Not a chef, just a regular guy who likes to cook.  I looked at several competators and decided that, for the price, this set was the best one out there.  I've had the opportunity to use most of the knives at this point and I find that they keep their edge very well and are extraordinarily easy to clean up.  They have a nice heft to them and the handles seem to be just the right size.  The only drawback that I see is that I would have preferred an 8&quot; chefs knife instead of the 6&quot; that comes with the set.  Overall excellent for the price and an absolutely sufficient set for novice

After failing to find a simple, easy to use travel clock in local stores I decided to search online and got this one. Even though it's inexpensive, the craftmanship isn't shoddy: all the parts fit together well and are easy to adjust. Parts of it glow in the dark (including the hands, number marks, and pop-up part that lets you know that you set the alarm).

It's very quiet and doesn't take up much space. If only more things in life were like this great little clock

This little clock measures 2.25 x 2.25 x 1.25 inches (5.5 x 5.5 x 3.3 cm). There's one simple knob to set the time and alarm, and the knob is easy to manipulate even without tiny fingers Little glow in the dark accents on the hands help with night vision, though they are not very bright.

To turn the alarm on just pop up the gray lever on the top. Smack it to shut the alarm off (you could press it gently, but it DID just wake you up, right?). 

There is no snooze feature, but for $5, it's a great value as a travel alarm, in case you nap in your car, or as a backup should your primary alarm clock fail you.

You just need to add your own AA battery to get it running

My wife wanted two sets to match our new family room decor.  Well, they turned out to be so beautiful that we have replaced our good formal china with this set.  Really gorgeous pattern and color.  The red has a slight orange cast and is not a perfect match for a more maroon red.

The sets arrived in perfect condition although the two outside box were very beat up.  Excellent packaging.  A fabulous deal

Why would you get a smaller toaster oven when you can get this one at such a good price?  It works well, looks good and you can actually fit things in it.  Never be frustrated by what you can't fit in your toaster oven!

I bought this set after the recent issues with Teflon. I did my research on all non-Teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the Aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may (key word here is may) contribute to Alzheimer's (according to some), and the Stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods, both of which I am allergic too. Pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive; a good set of a few items are $600+. There are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by Corning/Pyrex called Visionware (also known as Visions) that can be found on eBay (and a few are left here on Amazon) as they are no longer in production. Finally, there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternatives

The items have been great so far, however, you will really want to do some research in google (or any other search engine) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really shouldn't do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water (it will crack or break) etc. In addition, you will also want to so some research on how to "season" them which makes them very close to being non-stick (you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and "bake" the pans for an hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit). I did this and I just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick Teflon pan, but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan.

The downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you cannot stick the pan into the dishwasher (and I tried....it will come out a little bit rustier-but the little rust does come off very easily). The sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me. So I think I will buy one more in a larger size.

The upsides are price, no chemicals (except for some iron) in your food, easy to care for, and very non stick when seasoned. This is a great starter set

Ok let me start by saying I am not a coffee snob, I am more of a coffee nut, I very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers I wont turn up my nose.  And for a guy like me this machine is perfect!!  I looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something I see myself using 4-5 days out of the week so I setteled on this machine and I have not one regret.

I have had the machine about 3 weeks now, I admit I dont use it every day as I have thoses mornings where I am just running late and dont have time, but in that three weeks I have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great.  This thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods I was just amased, my old machine went down quite a while ago so I havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine I was sipping a great one in minutes!

The one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods, I bought the machine thinking I would use them as they seemed so convient...and dont get me wrong, the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso I have ever had, very quickly, but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and I have found it better to just pack my own double shots.  But besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me, it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for, be it a straight shot, a cappucino, or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you, may not be good enough for a coffee snob...but just right for a coffee nut!

Oh and one hint I found very helpfull...turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it (the longer the better) with your cups up on the warmer.  I saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out, I exprenced the same problem when I dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup, but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso!

Best investment I have ever made in cookware.  Heats evenly, more thoroughly and burns less.  Amazingly tough and the best part is I don't have to hunt for special "plastic" utensils to mix and stir.  This is sweet cookware and so dang easy to clean, I love it!

I almost didn't purchase these because of the reviews, But my son likes Thomas, so I did. I was expecting really rough, but I don't think they are all THAT bad. Maybe the company has taken the reviews under consideration and changed material. Anyway, the boy is quite happy with them and sleeps quite soundly.

I have twin boys and for their 3rd birthday their room was being done in all Thomas the Tank.  These sheets were a real thrill for them.  I only wish they would come in a higher thread count or softer fabric. The boys don't seem to care, however

It's well-made, sturdy, good looking pet crate. I bought the small first for my 12-pound cat, and it was MUCH too large, so I exchanged it for the extra small and it is just right. Remember that it's a crate, so don't look for the handle

It's pretty comfortable, but what new mattress isn't? The foam-memory material takes a little getting used to. I generally prefer a very firm mattress, and had to get used to the "sinking-in" feeling. I've also found you can't really use a lot of pillows.
What I like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns, or gets out of bed, you don't feel it.
The smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell, but it isn't as obnoxious as it's made out to be, but definitely present. If ignored, it will linger for about a month or so. I didn't try to spray anything on it because it didn't really bother me that much.
Over all it's a good mattress, although not the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress, and feel I've definitely gotten my moneys worth. I would recommend it.

For an inexpensive pizza stone, it does the job.  If you're looking for something that is more versatile, look somewhere else.  This stone is primarily for breads, pizza and the like.  I know this because I tried baking cookies on it. The cookies turned out fine, but they stuck to the stone. However, when I make home made pizza from scratch, the crust comes out perfect! Not too soft, not too crisp. It bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust

By far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non-stick pans.  It's already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches.  It also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface.

I got this pan because I've been coveting All-Clad when reading reviews of high-end cookware, and because of the low price.  I figured that the low price made it a teaser--something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line.  It's a nice pan, but limited.  On the good side, it's hefty, has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove, heats evenly and holds the heat. It is not non-stick, so I use it when I want the contents to produce the fabled &quot;brown bits&quot; that come up with deglazing.  Stuff sticks, unless you use a lot of fat. As noted by other reviewers, it does not have a pouring spout.  The rim is squared off, so the pouring stream tends to be very wide.  My other major gripe is that it does not have a lid.  All-Clad lids are pricey, like everything else in their line.  I sometimes use a cheap tempered-glass lid with it.    I still covet All-Clad pans, but not as much as I did before

I need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price PLUS 6 napkins.  Both packets arrived  dirty with many hanging threads and I threw them straight into the washer. They are 55% cotton and 45% polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free.  I am very happy with these basic table linens.  I like the price too.

This is the best, most beloved item in my kitchen!!!

I only wish I had bought the grinder and all the different cups (which I am going to now add on).

I read some of the other reviews---and at first I was also disappointed with this blender.  Now that I have learned how to use it, I LOVE IT!!! 

DO NOT put Protein powder into it first, it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup which you invert onto the blades (When you invert it, the bottom becomes the top).  If you put liquid in first and then the powder there's no problem.  You have to learn how to use it.  You will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick.  

I read the reviews here before I bought mine and a woman said hers was junk but I went ahead and read the rest of the reviews and decided to buy it.  If mine breaks in a year, it will have been well worth the price.  I use it every day and sometimes three times a day.  On a hot day when I want something slushy and cold, I'll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice---in a flash you have a refreshing drink.  It's fabulous.

I could use my Cuisinart, but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison.  There are no buttons to push, you just fill the cup with your juice (I often add protein powder) and something frozen (Ice or frozen fruit) and screw on the lid (which have blades in it) and put it on the blending base and twist.  You can either twist and pusle it, or twist and leave it to blend on its own.  Then you take the lid off, rinse, and that's it. 

I love hummus and I will never make it in the blender because you have to dig it out and most of it gets left behind.  With this gadget, you fill the cup, blend it, then screw off the blade lid, screw on the refrigerator lid, and that's it.  Nothing to scrape, just put it in the refrigerator.  (Oh yes, you do have to rinse off the blade lid, that's the whole clean-up).

If you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend, this is a great gadget!!!  I live in two places and I am getting another one for the other place, but I'm buying the complete set this time

It does everything I need it to and more! I'm a raw foodist so I don't need something that will "cook" foods like some of the other high-powered blenders will. However, if that's what you need one for, this will do that, too. The L'equip is the only blender I have ever used without the lid (not advised for households with children). I can start it out at a crawl and go up to blindingly fast with a turn of the knob. I liked my original one so much that I bought one to have at the office so my green smoothies could be made fresh for lunch. Alton Brown was showing off his appliances on "Good Eats" and he has a L'equip, too. Made me feel famous

The pan arrived on time and undamaged in the factory box.  The nonstick surface is slicker than the hardened titanium one used on Scanpan, and cleans easily.  The rotating vent on the glass lid is a nice feature.  My wife was skeptical at first, but I've caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently- in fact, it's become their favorite pan!  Unlike a pure teflon finish, this pan will brown the food nicely.  As far as durability goes, well, it's too early to tell, but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product.  I like it

Well I used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts I say go for it.  not bad for the price I recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic.

I have tried all kinds of feather pillows and foam pillows but just could not get comfortable sleeping on my side.  While shopping for a new mattress, I came across the Simmons Beautyrest pillow.  What a difference!  It provides great support but is still soft and comfortable.  Now I don't toss and turn all night, and I actually get up earlier in the morning and feel rested for the first time in a long time.  I definitely recommend this pillow for people who sleep on their side and are looking for good support

I love my spice rack, don't get me wrong--I mounted it under my cabinet to increase storage space in my tiny kitchen.  Unfortunately, sometimes when I spin it (gently, as always) the entire rack comes off and falls apart!  The spices go everywhere and creates a mess--not to mention wastes spices.  I had it come off twice in one week.  It happens if we spin it clockwise or counter clockwise--there is no way to 'lock' it into place, it sits in a channel, but is not locked.  So, look out when you spin, or put your other hand underneath it to steady it.  

Also--really fine spices like cinnamon, tend to escape and dust behind.  I don't mind it, but if you're a clean freak, it'll drive you insane--it gets everywhere

I have had this product for 8 yrs - before the internet!  I make a meal for my husband & family every nite & could hardly live without this product.  It really eliminates the need to wash & dry measuring spoons and takes all the hassle out of making dishes with many ingredients - at least you don't have to get a utensil out for measuring spices.  I have had this product in 3 homes (I'm a military spouse) and it has been able to mount under the cabinets in 2 houses thus saving me valuable counterspace & cabinet space due to the small kitchens in military housing.  I would highly reccommend this to those who like to cook in tight spaces.  Every move, I just empty the spices & run the canister thru the dishwasher, then set out to dry.  Of course, the labels had started to come off after 7 years so I simply printed out some new "cutesy" labels for those spices I constantly measure.  As I remember, the labels that came with the package included most every spice you could ever want.  Money well spent -- 8 yrs ago my hubby bought this for me & it has survived a lot of cooking and moves

I bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before Christmas, 2006.  It seemed like a perfect - if unnecessary - stocking stuffer for my wife, since we're both wine enthusiasts.  I never really felt these "gimmick" aerators did much that a solid 1/2 hour decanting couldn't do.  Boy was I wrong.

The device itself is attractive, compact and solidly built.  It appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass "funnel" with a rubber grip.  There are two small channels in the center of the funnel, which look like "cracks" in the plastic (I've read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable).  Wine is poured through the top of the funnel, and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel.  The aerator is easily held, and I've never had a problem with spills.

Now on to the "effect" of the Vinturi.  I've been using the Vinturi for 5 months now, on a variety of wines ... from a bottle of "Two Buck Chuck", to a nice '98 Vietti Barolo, to a bottle of 97' Phelps Insignia.  In every circumstance, with every wine, I've noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the Vinturi, as opposed to tasted directly from bottle.  The flavours are more blended, the finish is less acidic, and frankly, it has made most of the wines I drink a more pleasurable experience, from sniff to swallow.   I've conducted several "blind" tastings with friends, and we all agree - this thing works.  

If you're a serious wine drinker - or shopping for a wine drinker in your life - give this product a try.  At $40, it's about the price of a decent California Cabernet, and will yield results for decades to come.  I plan on picking up a few dozen this Christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients

I use this desk chair frequently, as a student I spend many hours sitting and studying at my desk.  The chair doesn't take up much space in my small apartment and it is comfortable and sturdy. Plus, it was a great value, so even if it doesn't last forever, I am very happy for now

Now she has a lot more room in her sewing room. We opted to paint it, but it can be stained also. 
We reccommend it highly

My son and I LOVE this item!  It's so fun to be able to quickly and easily make shaved ice.  Sometimes we freeze juice or soda in the molds (rootbeer is a favorite!), and sometimes we just use regular ice and sno-cone syrup.  This is one of the best kitchen gadgets I've ever purchased!!

      I used this pan just this morning and I really like it.  It has a great non-stick surface and is easy to clean.  The price is great also.    
    The only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle.  It slants downward instead of upward.  So, if you have a flat surface stovetop, your pan won't sit flat on the surface.  I have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me.  I didn't notice this from the picture and the descriptions don't mention this but I think it is important to know.  Who knows, maybe I got a defective pan and don't know it. 
     Other than that, it is a great pan for the money.  I like it more than other non-stick pans I have had.

This item saves space because it folds everything to the same size.  It is god's gift to those of us who have small closets and hate messes.  I first saw it when a clerk at a store was using it to put clothes back on the floor for sale.  I tried to buy it off her and she told me the name of the company.  I LOVE the flip-fold.  You won't be sorry if you buy this item

I bought this for my two "classic" Revere Ware 2Qt pots (marked "Clinton, Ill") and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces. All of today's Revere Ware, including this lid, are made overseas. The pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel, but this glass lid works fine.

I had to replace my Space Saver B&D on a sunday morning.  I wanted another thermal carafe model but wasn't realy ready to shell out $80 for the Braun even witht the good reviews.  I found this on clearance at Target for $35 and I bought a Cuisinart gold filter for it.  I did not like the fact the Mr Coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter.  Anways, there is not much I can say bad about this machine.
Things I like:  looks,brew seletor,self clean feature,makes good coffee,the carafe is one the best I have used.  The easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well, inexpensive and work pretty well.  I dont have any of the leak problems.  Things I would change: could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker,the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but I tend to set it to go on before the family is up.  Overall for what I paid for this I'm very pleased

We just purchased ours this past week and we love it!!  We've had glass coffee makers before and we used to waste so much coffee because it sat on the burner and burnt.  Now we throw away nothing!  Sometimes we wake up the next morning and there is still a half a pot left. A good 1 minute zap in the microwave and it tastes just as good as it did when it was first brewed. 
This is our second thermal coffee maker and we have found that unless you REMOVE the coffee filter holder after each use and rinse it, it will leak all over.  Coffee grounds get stuck in the little holes where the coffee comes out and into the thermal pot. Also to stop the leak problem, be careful when putting in coffee grounds, make sure none get past it. 

Im a little surprised at the negatives reviews on this product.  Its an in expensive coffee maker and it does the job very well.  

THE OVER-FLOWING OF COFFEE AND THE LEAKAGE PROBLEM IS DUE TO IMPROPER HOUSEKEEPING. WE HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS.

rarely does a product move me to write a review but I have found myself increasingly using the net (and amazon) to review products I am not really familiar with before buying them.  Rice cookers were one of those products.  So I thought I'd share my experience since I had a hard time finding a review for this rice cooker to help others out.  We were microwave rice and stovetop rice cookers until we started eating a lot of sushi.  Then we wanted something to make the "perfect rice".  This is it.  The first time we used it, I let my girlfriend make the rice.  It boiled over and made a huge mess and came out totally mushy.  I was bummed I spent $200 on a rice cooker that was going to be messy or difficult to use.  Then, I watched my girlfriend making it the second time and realized she was putting in 2 times the amount of water required.  Following the directions, the 25 or 30 times we have used it since, we get absolutely PERFECT rice.  White rice, sticky rice, whatever.  It is sylish so it doesn't look like a little crock pot sitting in my contemporary kitchen, the cord retracts into the base for convenience and the thing couldn't be easier to clean.  The rice pot, the lid and the steam vent pop out and are easily cleaned.  Wipe the rest down with a damp paper towel and you're done.  So easy.  Rarely is "set it and forget it" associated with perfection, but in this case it is.  Would I prefer if it was $100-$150, sure.  But I paid $200 and don't regret it.

Being a wine lover, I've used all kinds of corkscrews, from your basic twist model to the kind with the "wings" to the two-pronged kind. Finally, I received the Screwpull as a gift, and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end! As others have said, the Screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up, so there's no actual "pulling" whatsoever--all you do is simiply turn the easy-to-use lever at the top of the device. In almost 10 years of usage, the Screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork; on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try (probably because I started too close to the edge), simply starting over solved the problem. Spend a little more money to buy the Screwpull, and you'll never need to buy another corkscrew again; highly recommended

We bought one for my home office, and my largest cat loved it but couldn't fully fit on it (he likes to stretch out when he sleeps).  He was doing whatever he could to make it work.  So then we bought a second one to put right next to the first, and his reaction was one of pure love and ecstasy.  One cat can get on each, although the largest will share space from the other.  (we have no small cats) But since we have three cats, and sometimes petsit a fourth, that area gets crowded sometimes, and there are hissing fights.  I don't have quite enough window space for a third.

Right now I'm looking for replaceable covers, and I'm not having much luck.  We've had these for a few years, and try to keep them cleaned, but it's a pain.  We need to replace them

I bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working. I find it easy to insert the cans. It works great if you follow the directions. It's not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around. Cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink. It's a good buy

This far exceeds any similar bowl.  So what if the other reviewer has to flip this thing 3 times to get his/her heep of sugar.  Personally, I replaced my sugar bowl/spoon server so that my children would not over do it on the sugar in their morning cereal.  The product feels and looks great and functions well.  I ended up buying another one for my work location.  It is super easy to clean and the fact that it is of simple design makes after use clean up a snap.

After 10 years in the kitch, I have good skills with knife. 

But, first day with this knife, I cut my finger. Shun cuts yam like tofu, it happen so fast that I wasn't even able to react to it. I need to be extra careful with this blade

What an awesome product!  Heavy-duty and sturdy, you'd never know it was an "assemble-at-home" item.   It's a quality piece of furniture.  It's on wheels, which is a good thing because it is surprisingly heavy.

Let's start at the top:  The butcher block top.  It's three inches thick and, as such, it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart.  It is made of fine, high-quality Asian hardwoods.  The finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil.

The next is the cart itself.  Immediately under the butcher block top, there is a 2" deep drawer.  It's large and deep enough to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice.  The pull handle on the drawer is fashioned out of brushed chrome.

Beneath the drawer, there is a shelf.  Surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods, adding a modern look.  Matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart, perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders.

Below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors.  The pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish.  The cabinet is large enough to hold an entire set of dinnerware (as in my case where I have eight place settings that include dinner and luncheon plates, fruit and soup bowls, and more).

Finally, heavy-duty, professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing.  The two in the front are locking.  To prevent stubbed toes, the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit.

The easy to follow directions for assembly (which are diagrammed and in English) call only for a Philips screwdriver.  A hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts.  I used an electric screwdriver for both the Philips screws (14 in all) and the hex bolts (after I found the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver).

I can happily report that all pieces fit together easily (no struggling to match up this piece with that piece) and all holes are pre-drilled.

The drawer requires assembly also.  The runners for the drawer are already attached!  You must put together the front, sides and back of the drawer with screws (again, all holes are pre-drilled).  

A word of advice regarding assembling the drawer:  Follow the directions where it says to put the screws in only halfway before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer.  I made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble sliding the bottom into the assembled front, back and sides.  It's a snug fit.  Once I loosened the screws enough, the bottom easily popped into place and I was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws.

I have only one other thing to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart: Once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright, you must lift the butcher block and set it down on the top of the cart.  At this point, you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart and they're pointing upward.  These screws will fit into four pre-drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block.  You must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart.  Because the butcher block is so heavy, you may want to have help.

But what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture it ended up being.  IKEA sells a similar item for twice the money.

I give the Home Styles Double Door Kitchen Cart with Butcher Block Top 5 stars because of the beauty of the product and its better-than-a-bargain price

There isn't much you can say about a sharpening steel. It sharpens well, and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest. The handle is ugly gray plastic, but it seems solidly put together, and is easy to work with

I bought this for my husband three years ago, and he absolutely loves it.  In fact, many people who come to our house ask about it, as the coffee is superb.  We are very picky about our coffee, tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves, and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years.  I would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model.  The coffee is usually hot throughout the day (depending on how much is in it, of course), as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee.  We have never had the first problem with boilovers, leaking, implosions (huh?), etc.  In fact, I'm getting one for my daughter and her husband for Christmas, as they always admire ours

This is great!  Easy set up, dishwasher safe (top shelf only), and super quiet (there is a very faint humm) our cats went right over to check it out.  It is kinda big but I expected that from the picture.  The only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher. 5 stars!!! I'd give it more if I could

I bought this  fan 2 years ago from Phoenix   and it is still going strong! Its quiet and unwaveringly loyal.  I bought my 2nd one just the other day as a gift for my son in Seattle.  He enjoys his as much as I enjoy mine. The remote is a big hit with us both.   If I can I'm going to send a 3rd one to my sister in Seattle. She is in a studio apt..this fan is perfect.

We have almost all of Santa Fe Collection.
It's colorful and brings a smile to your face early in the morning during your breakfast and everytime you have a meal.
Plates are of a good size, bowls are perfect for cereal or fruit.
And the mugs, oh! they are so unique! Their shape and their size are just what we were looking for.
My husband says it's perfect for his morning latte.
The pieces of this set are heavy and nicely made.
We have 2 sets of 2 sets of these place settings and they are on everyday use.
Bigger pieces, such as pasta bowl, dip and chip bowl we hand wash.
The other pieces go strait to the dishwasher. Never had a problem, in fact we're proud owners.

I purchased the smallest version, the LW 14, for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows.

Air ionizers didn't rid the air of the frying smells, but this appliance works. 

The initial price is high, but not the cost to keep the Venta running. Water is cheap. Power consumption on highest setting is about 35 Watt. For whisper-quiet use in a bedroom a lower setting is better. Any air-con would be much louder anyways and drown out the Venta on the highest setting.

The motor used to power the machine is indeed very silent, and possible can't be manufactured for 30$. The other components are ruggedly constructed and hopefully last many years.

The device can also be used for aromatherapy, which I'm just testing with some natural Mint oil against my cold

I already had a cake lifter. When I visited my daughter and her husband at Christmas, they were lifting a coffee cake out of the oven using two small spatulas. I knew how much easier it would have been with the cake lifter so I wanted to get one for them. Googled spatulas and was amazed at how many there were. Finally found one just like mine and ordered two of them - one for each daughter. I have given one hers and she was delighted. Will give the other one hers when I visit in March. I use mine often and am glad to have it - don't believe enough people know there is such an item on the market. Too bad it isn't sold more widely

Impressive machine overall.  I've had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch.  Looking around on the internet, this seems to be fairly common.  I understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things, but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine.

The attachments are great for hard floors, and furniture.

I am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time I use the machine, but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point, even the refurbished one

My husband loves cereal for breakfast, and I bought it so he doesn't have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal. It was a perfect fit for him, and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses. I was surprised at how big it was, but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful. The rubber turn knob doesn't jam up as easily as I expected, although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense. Only complaints: 1. The top plastic covers are not completely airtight, but are fine for dry cereal. 2. The bottom rubber covers fall out easily - they should fit more snugly

It is more of a light tan color, but the price was too good compared to other sets I've seen at Pier 1,ect...  so I won't be retuning it.  Just want you all to know it's not white, but very sturdy.

Great weight and balance, superb craftsmanship, the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all, the pricing is terrific.  I have All-Clad and yes, it is wonderful but quite frankly I find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less.  And it is still made in U.S.A.

Great For Daily Use - Nott Made For Heavy Duty Cleaning

I read the reviews before I purchased this machine. I know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of. So with this in mind I will put in my 2 cents.  

I have had my machine for two months and I use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults, a 4 year old and two dogs. Generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket. 

You must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease. 

The machine is set up to auto-shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low. I agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine. A powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive. I see what Hoover was trying to do with this machine. They were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine. They gave it a good shot but for all of us clean-freaks this machine doesn't quite hit the mark.

The water/cleaning solution section is, in my humble opinion, to small. I run out of water quickly and I have a very small kitchen. But the good news is that my kitchen is so small I can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up. :)  

One more comment before I give my final review...remember to follow the instructions and use ONLY the kind of cleaners Hoover recommends. There's a reason for this. If you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die! The grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets.

So my final opinion is this. If you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it's a great time saver. It's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac-up of dog hair, scrub and mop. Any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment, mop and bucket routine. If you are a cleanfreak, like me, you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand-and-knees scrub. No machine will ever leave you satisfied. This machine was definately NOT made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it's great.

I am giving this machine 4 stars because I think it does what it was designed to do...light cleaning. I would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice.

When Hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum, scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards I'll be all over it! Until then, I'll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month.

Very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate, this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room.  Our dog - a rescued Border Collie - is incontinent, so she cannot roam around the house.  And while she prefers being outdoors, with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside, in the same room as her family (instead of out back in the mud room, where her old wire cage was)

I've always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for:

1.  Keeps the beverage hot for hours.
2.  When sealed, it does not leak at all.
3.  Easy to drink from and dribble-free.
4.  Suitable for right and left hand drinkers.
5.  Fits into most car cup holders.
6.  Clips to straps/loops/handles to carry easily, even when filled.
7.  Easy to clean and stays stain/smell free.
8.  Rubber accents provide non-slip grips and doesn't make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table.
9.  High quality construction for durability.
10. It looks really cool!

This mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug.  I look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug.  Finally, a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user.  This is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price

I got this for our 3-year-old daughter's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater. It does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room, which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night. I wouldn't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room. The top and back do get hot, although you'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned; bumping into it should not cause any burns. I haven't noticed any odors or noises from it

I just received this set yesterday and haven't had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet (I'll try to remember to update this review once I do), but there were a few initial impressions I thought merited a review on their own: 

- The cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package. Instead, the kit contained a small fold-out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook. 

(I doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook, or even that it sways many would-be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit. But its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase, and is something you should know before you buy.) 

- That having been said, the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good, I have no doubt whatsoever that they'll be wonderful, functional additions to my kitchen. The hard-anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability. I'm impressed.  

And I'll be back to say more once I actually use them to make pizzas!

This worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines- cute as a button!  It works the same as the large madeleine pans, and is made from the same heavy weight metal, but the result is darling.  Would be great for tiny "garnish" on a larger dessert, for a tea, or just because some people prefer small doses of good things!

These are great knives, especially for the price.  They are just like the Pro-S line from Henckels only are not hardened the same way.  They are sharp.  The chefs knife sliced a very ripe tomato straight out of the box.  They have excellent weight and balance and the handles are comfortable.  All in all, a great buy!  I can't believe I used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible.  Definitely worth their weight in gold

I received this coffeemaker as a Christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket-style filter.  After using the maker for a week, I have to say my skepticism was unjustified.  This machine makes great-tasting coffee that is as hot as I could want it.  I never liked the "cooked" coffee that regular, glass-carafe makers produced - burned tasting after the first cup.  The coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last.  I fill the carafe with hot water, mill my beans and fill the reservoir, empty the carafe and enjoy.  After two hours, the coffee was still hot.  One great feature not highlighted is the front-fill aspect:  Kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front, right next to the filter.  No more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level.  Extremely convenient.

I have to disagree with the previous reviewer - this machine makes ten 5-ounce cups.  After reading the review, I double-checked the carafe capacity against my old Krups machine:  exactly 10 cups; more than enough for our household.  All in all, a great-looking, great-performing coffeemaker that meets Kitchenaid's high standards.  I highly recommend it

This was a lot of fun. Its big and different from my Golden's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound, not a squeak but a honk, if you will.

The problem came when my Golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker. This is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog's short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan.

The kitchen odors were getting very bad. We realized that the filter had never been changed. It is an old recirculating system over the stove. Finding filters is for the birds. Filters are all listed by a serial or code number. I think the psychology is that you use ONLY the filter from the original manufacturer. After looking at many different types of filters, these seemed to be cutable-is that a word? We did not need to cut, they fit into the Nutone range hood perfectly. Our nutone hood is so old that we could not find anything listed on the Nutone site.
So these fit, the house odor while cooking is diminished. What is not clear is how often they should be replaced. Obviously when the smell gets worse, but I have no idea if 6 months or 6 years. Will buy more, cheaper than a new hood

This toaster oven is perfect.  I have had this oven for about 6 months and had enjoyed cooking meals in the summer months without heating up the entire house.  I have even cooked a whole chicken in it.  This oven cooks food evenly and I have had no problems with it at all.  I highly recommend this product.

Update.  I still have this toaster oven and use it almost everyday.  I still absolutely love it and don't understand why everyone else seems to have issues with it.  I don't know what I would do with out this oven.  I have owned it for over 3 years and it still works perfect.  I recently cooked a prime rib in it and it turned out fabulous

I own dozens of wine glasses from the most expensive lead crystal to winery logo glasses. I also have a set of Reidel Vinum's as well. I bought these for everyday/dishwasher use. Wow! Both the Red and White are wonderful... I side by side taste tested (glass to glass) my Chardonnay (yes, mine) and the White Wine Glass was way above average and perfect for everyday. Frankly, white wine dosen't need a snifter glass as some do...Tip: It also helps to not fill the glass to the top and please don't freeze the Chardonnay!

<review_text>
When trying to decide if this model (3670G) was the right vacuum for me, I found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it's features on the internet..and from the manufacturer itself. First of all, many online retailers flat out state (inaccurately) that this model has a "HEPA" (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on Amazon (at least as of this writing) seems to indicate that it has one as well. I can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does *NOT* have a "HEPA" filter. More on that a little later in this review however.

I found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number (i.e. 3670G). Be careful to understand the difference between what Amazon calls the 3670 (also called the 3670A in some places) and the 3670*G* models. They look identical and appear to be identical (both are yellow and black) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670G has the larger, 12 amp motor. Amazon carries both models and I almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum. For only about a $5-$10 difference in total price, I'm not sure why the smaller version is even offered. It only seems to confuse the matter. The 3670 also does *NOT* have the "HEPA" filter incidentally.

I found the 3670G to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase. It is compact, very powerful and great for my needs. The noise...while high...is  quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans. The generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful, not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down. The blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides (by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing).

The 3670G *does* require bags. It is not a "bagless" model however and while some may prefer a bagless model, I preferred a model that used bags. The bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what I consider to be the additional convenience (of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag).

The only reason I gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because I did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate. Three attachment tools are included, a crevice tool, a 10" floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush (about 2" wide) on the end. The combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up (3" wide).

In my opinion, this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush and/or pick up tool that is about 4-5" wide. The 2" wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2" wide, I found that I simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces (such as a wall for example) in order to cover the area needed. I would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5" wide had been included. As it is, I am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra. 

Finally, a comment about the "HEPA" filter. Some people (particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air) may want cleaners that include this item. In my case, I did not want this since I don't need it and "HEPA" filters can be quite expensive to change and replace (unless you get a washable one...also expensive). Since many online descriptions I found were unclear whether the 3670G included this filter (some descriptions flatly stated that it does), I found myself calling the Eureka customer service number to find out for sure.

It turned out that even Eureka's own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn't have one. If you *do* want the "HEPA" filter, you would want the 3684D...which looks the same but  is red in color, slightly more expensive, and has more and better quality attachments as well as the "HEPA" filter.  By the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment (which I mentioned earlier that I think is needed on the 3670G), you are at the price of a 3684D. In that case, the 3684D may well be a better value for you, particularly if you like the "HEPA" filter.    

Overall, I think "The Boss" series of canister vacuums is a great product. Eureka (and Amazon as well) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however.

I've gone through several fogless mirrors in the last 20 years and this one is simply the best.  I owned one before made by Z fogless and could not find a replacement when it was broken.  I had tried many other brands and found them to cloud up soon after I got them.  The Z Fogless is the best shower mirror and the price beat all the competition including ebay

I needed a saucepan to cook oatmeal in that would let go on the bits that stick to the bottom.  Sounds silly, but I love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards.  This cleans up easily and cooks evenly.  I have used it for cooking rice, gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well.  Now, for the lid.  There is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently.  I sat down, wrote an email to the company and by the next day, they have a new lid on the way.  They asked only where to send it, nothing else.  I like companies that stand by the product they sell.  So, if you are going to buy from this line, check that black band, it should be between the glass and the metal, not on the inside of the lid.  If you have a problem with the product, ALWAYS notify the manufacturer, they will almost always make it right, like Calphalon did for me

I was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did I find a nice one! With the arched back speaker portion of the stereo, it provides a surround-sound like atmosphere. Also it has quite a loud capacity for volume. I mean if you wanted to, you could really get it crankin'. Anyway, it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod. The sound clarity is very crisp and clear. The only, tiny flaw, I could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs, a soft, high-pitched whine is sometimes incurred. However, once the song begins to play, this whine disapears immediately. I would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price

This product is very well-constructed.  It is simple to use and easy to clean.  I use it to cook brown rice and dry beans, and it has cut my cooking time down immeasurably.  I have only had it a few months so far, and I have not been able to perfect the rice (there always seems to be too much water left at the end), but I will keep reducing the amount of water until I have the perfect mix.  I would highly recommend this pressure cooker to anyone, beginning cooks or seasoned culinary experts.  I'll certainly be sending one down to South Carolina for mothers day

I have  really nice Dansk everyday dishes, but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use. I have to admit, these dishes are really stylish! They look great on the table, are very lightweight, stack very compactly and are a nice large size. The only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls. They are small, and while they look really cool, the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around. If you're looking for bigger bowls for cereal, you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that Corelle makes. For salads, the square ones work just fine. A word of pricing caution: On Amazon at this moment they are $69 a set. I bought mine for $49 per set at my local Walmart

If you like fondue....you'll like raclette...as much or even more.  Use your imagination...don't stick with what is traditional.  You can use your raclette for desert, pizza, breakfast....and much more! Traditionally served with steamed red potatoes....this will satisfy the "meat and potatoe" man in the group.  Marinade the meat with different flavors...to add some spice.  Don't forget the vegetables....slice onion, red peppers, mushrooms, romas...and even pineapple. It's a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends.  Extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot

The price went down from $6.95 to $3.95.It's very nice looking,you will be pleased with it.Approximately 13 and a half inch square.I was expecting a black cloth loop to hang it from,but the loop turned out to be the sewn in label.That's okay

Bought these not too long ago. I use them all of the time. They do a great job on towels, men's under clothing, permanent press clothing, cleaning rags (not microfiber, Never soften those), etc. I find the drying time is a little less, the clothes do not tangle and they smell nice and clean. Best of all---no chemicals. If you have clothes with a lot of static cling, then you can throw in maybe half a dryer sheet to reduce that problem. I love these "little guys". Recommend them to all and especially chemically sensitive folks

I've lusted after a Super Auto for years. When I finally decided to get one, I did a fare amount of investigating. The Gaggia Titanium had the best spec's for the price and good reviews. I decided to spend the extra money for the Stainless unit. I haven't seen the painted plastic model so I can't comment on the appearance. I do think the Stainless looks great! You can find reviews of the non-stainless here on Amazon and other than the outside appearance, the device is the same. 

I've only had the unit for a few days but so far, I'm very happy. To the negatives first. The manual is awful! It's not just the Italian to English translation! The text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great. I spent a fair amount of time making sure I understood how to setup and use the unit. I'm pretty technically savvy and in the end, I figured it all out. But don't rush into using this product until you've figured out how to set it up, clean it and adjust all the settings (there are many).

The only issue I've had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it's empty when it's not. Open the lid (which could be a bit better designed) and stir and it works. Could be the beans I'm using not sure. It's an intermittent issue. 

The good stuff: once you figure out the coffee strength and grind, the Gaggia makes a delicious cup. I wish the brew were a tad hotter (I have it set to max) but using the cup warmer helps. No issues making froth with the wand; much better than the older manual machine I had. You can't put a huge mug under the unit (the max size is 4.5 inches) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed. You can set the unit for the amount of brew. However, I found that clicking the "large coffee" button twice, the unit thinks it's making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug. It's much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size. You get a nice foam on top and as I said, the coffee is outstanding. 

I love the clean up (or lack of) compared to the drip maker I had (a Bodum Vacuum unit). I still have that unit should I need to make a lot of coffee for company. But for the two mugs I drink in the morning, the Gaggia easily replaces this unit. And there's far less cleanup. The grinds sit in a canister and after a few days, you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse. So, you can use this Gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you're making a cup or two. What I love is just pressing a button twice (for two large coffees) and walking away from the unit. A minute later, a great cup of Joe. It truly is super automatic. 

I have the unit set for Energy savor whereby it's in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after I use it. I only drink in the morning. However, if you decide to "wake it up", it heats up in about 2 minutes. It also does a rinse cycle so I keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water. There is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days. There's also a "full Rinse" cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir. It's a menu item so don't select it unless you really want to do this (takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire). 

Yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks, I'm very happy. 

UPDATE. The issue with the grinder was the beans (too oily). I called the NY office and got someone in "tech support" in minutes. She knew her product. Sure enough, the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area.

A little disappointing. We have several Cuisinart products including a food processor that we've had for umpteen years and still works like new. We also have 4 Cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment. The toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced. We've only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it

Works just fine for my needs ... I use it to press my 'wrinkle-free' Dockers. The water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill . . . but once it is filled it lasts a good long time.  Heavy duty, well-constructed , dependable unit.  First package 'disappeared' at UPS.  When they shipped the first machine, it was evidently damaged and returned back to Amazon by UPS. (probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing)  The replacement shipment arrived just fine, and, as always Amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'

I read a few not so favorable reviews, mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand (which mine does not suffer), but I decided to order it anyway, figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand (you can also wall mount it).  Well it has paid off, as the magnets work as promised, the tines stay sealed tight, and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices.  I pitched the included spices and filled it with my own.  As for labels, there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices.  I honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack, and it has worked beautifully

I've had my juicer now for about 3 years, and I haven't had any problems with it.  In fact, after having had several juicers, this one is my favorite in the price range.  

I also don't understand the customer service problems.  One of the rubber feet on the bottom split, and I called customer service.  A week later I had four new ones in the mail!

Pros - much quieter than most juicers of its type.  As well, I did a side by side comparison with my buddie's Juiceman Juicer, and my yield was approximately 30% greater.

Cons - as with any other similar juicer, cleaning it gets old.  That's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times/day

Just a word of advice:  If your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up.  If they aren't, it probably is not the toy for your dog.  

At first, my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy.  It took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was "his".   Once I finally got him used to realizing it was his own, he saw me put his kibble in it.  Then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it.  Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.  I like interactive toys :)

On the other hand, our little dog, still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy.  Just a guess, he probably never will figure it out.  So, some dogs will take to it, and others will look at you like you're crazy for giving them a toy that doesn't squeak

I really like this kitchen gadget as it different, actually useful, and my hands smell less like garlic.  Thus far, I have only used it to chop herbs, onions, and garlic so I can't debunk the mush mess.  I would simply say, don't pull the cord a lot if you're worried about it.

I bought about 5 and gave them all out as x-mas gifts

I haven't used this for herbs but I have used it for onions and garlic and, like the other reviewers, found it very handy for quick and tear-free mincing. It's a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect. I love that it's only 3 small parts (4 if you count the rubber blade) that all fit easily into the dishwasher (top rack).

I bought this for my 2 dogs & it works great & cleans up easily! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it's large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home. It doesn't fit under my kitchen sink faucet. I don't have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer (wish I did))otherwise it would be a snap to fill. I have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs. The container is really heavy once it's full. My only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one (2 gallon or 1 gallon), waterer. It would be easier to handle. I also bought the 5 gallon feeder & I LOVE it! It holds a whole 5lb. bag of food which is great! So get the larger feeder & the smaller waterer. Oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it! :

I highly recommend the Spiegelau Authentis line for value and beauty.  These glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day.  While a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine, they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used (and washed!) on a regular basis.  If you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience, give these a try

Nice little toaster with good price.  Just be careful it can get really hot when toasting.

Not fancy. But it does the basic jobs well. Minor concern  - better at baking than toasting. Toasting takes a little too long and is not totally uniform. But for the price this machine can't be beat.

I love going to other peoples party's and sharing a few drinks, but never had a good way to carry to bottles of bubbly or other drink of choice before this product. 
I purchased an Orange one last year, and like it so much I'm giving them as gifts this holiday season. 
They fit almost any Round or Squire 750ml bottle (Absolute, Sky, Captain, Jose Cuervo, Bushmills). However oddly shaped bottles a bit of a tight fit, like Baileys

I received this as a Christmas gift.  I've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane.  I had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles.  I found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you're flying. It's the best way I've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere

i have made 3 batches with it and everyone has come out perfect.  just add the mix water and a packet of brewers yeast and even a small packet of baking yeast will work.  its easy no mess and you dont need to add any sugar unlike its lower priced ugly cousin mr beer. the only recomenation i have is when you pour half of it with water then add the mix stir it untill almost disolved then add more water.  make sure its alittle warmer then room tempature. alot of it will disolve.  then add the yeast and wait about 5 days then put it in the fridge for 10 and it will be perfect

This is a nice product.  It gets the job done. I have to disagree with the one reviewer.  The description plainly states that the board is made of polyethylene.  The midnight granite signifies the color.
For $9.99, 14x17 is a great price

It's a wonderful cutting board (also available at the store) I'm a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something I've found very useful. Any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic. This one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks.  
 The $9.99 price tag isn't bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well. That, and it just looks great in the kitchen. I use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and wouldn't go without them. 
  
 Don't listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a 14 X 17 solid granite cutting board for ten bucks, not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives.  
 FYI to the moron - &amp;amp;quot;Protect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight, tough, polyethylene cutting boards.&amp;amp;quot; Yah, nothing at all... dimwit

The Franciscan Apple Dinnerware Covered Sugar Bowl is a perfect match for the Franciscan Apple Creamer. You can keep granulated sugar or sugar cubes in this bowl. Mine is in constant use for the coffee and tea drinkers as well as for those who like a bit of sugar on their morning cereal or grapefruit half. A must-have for the Franciscan Apple collector

They worked so well. We decided to have a themed drink for our Superbowl party this year. It was in Miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees. We served Cubano sandwiches and Mojito cocktails. The mojito's were a hit. We set up a "mojito education station" on our computer playing the Bacardi mojito video, then we had a station set up with mint,sugar, rum,lime wedes, ice and soda water. This muddle was an excellent purchase. It did the job efficiently and well. Even Mojito novices got the hang of it easily. 

Great buy and good luc

This little Franciscan Apple Dinnerware Creamer is so beautifully made. There is a matching sugar bowl and lid, too. I do not use mine to hold cream or half-and-half on an everyday basis because I would have to keep it covered with saran wrap so the liquid would not absorb any refrigerator odors. However, I do love to use it when I use my Franciscan Apple Coffepot or when entertaining at a dinner party. There is also a small milk jug, and there are two other larger pitchers in the Apple pattern. I have also used the Apple creamer as a server for sauces

I purchased these to use with my Steamfast mop. They are machine washable and fit fine even after being thrown in the dryer. Perhaps the Steamfast head is slightly smaller than the Bissell...I don't know about that but they fit well on it. They are sturdy and well made.

this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with. I have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all. It's so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors. The only complaint I have is that the pads are hard to get on. I have broke a few nails doing this, it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this

I just received this wine tower the other day.  It looks as wonderful in my home as it does in the picture.  It's perfect for our needs and takes up so little space.  The ONLY complaint I have, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it was a pain for my husband to put together.  Also, it came with 2 bottom shelves, instead of one bottom and one top...he had to improvise until I can get this corrected with the manufacturer. (Fortunately, it's not noticeable)In spite of this, I recommend this wine tower for anyone wanting an expensive looking wine tower that is so space efficient at this price.  I've already gotten compliments on it from friends.

It does exactly what it says. State of the art cutlery, cutting vegetables becomes a pleasure. It is stunning the precision of this knife; you set it on the food push it and goes down the exact direction intended. It did not go 1/1000 of an inch to left or to the right. I used it for onion, and let me tell you; never in my life was so easy, at the end the onion was so small chopped. It felt like I was cutting air. I even bought a kitchen electric chopper precisely to use it for cutting onions. I do not need it anymore. 
The design it is so sleek and elegant! I felt in love with it only by seeing it on the picture, after a research on the internet I bought it and I am not sorry. I got tired to try and replace knives. Definitely, I will buy the Shun Set. I highly recommended, like no other product!

I've had this pot for over a year and love it. Fast, hot, great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time. I bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because I loved the looks of it, and there were limited choices at the brick-and-mortars.  I read all the reviews only after I bought it. The reviewers' major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking. Yes, the plastic knob is poorly-designed and is the only reason I give this pot 4 stars instead of 5. The designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob. However, it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all. Just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot. This is what I've been doing since I bought the pot and I've had absolutely no problems with the knob. It's unlikely you'll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot, so you can avoid burned fingertips. A secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee. I've never had this problem; I suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket, or they are using the wrong grind. It's important with any percolator to use a percolator grind, or  "FAC" 'for all coffeemakers' grind.

I left my old pressure cooker (a Tefal made of steel) in storage in another state and I was dying to have a new one. I bought this because the price was great and the description seemed to make this set attractive and I'm very glad I did. Both pots (the large and the smaller) fit the pressure lid so it's like having two pressure cookers instead of one. One night I cooked lamb in the small pot and in 20 minutes I had a very nice and super tender meal and the next day I made beef broth with the large cooker so that I could freeze it and pull it out anytime I want it. I'm very satisfied with this product, it looks great, it's very efficient and it's very strong and durable. The set also comes with a cooking book containing easy recipes of all kinds, from main courses to desserts and even a table with cooking time for many items

very good rice cooker. The steam function is very useful for such a lazy student like me. I can cook the rice and steam my food at the same time. 
I used it for almost a month but still working functionally. 
Highly recommended if you dun wanna pay too much for a useful rice cooker

A beautiful pan from Kitchenaid.  I use it for everything and the lid is a big bonus.  Think of it as a 10" skillet you use everyday, which can also go into the oven, and also be used for serving.  Quality and heft is better than all clad

This coat rack is simple and sturdy.  It has several pegs for longer coats at the top and below are ones just the right height for my daughter to reach.  It can handle many coats and other items you toss on it without falling over.  Color is nice although we usually see little of it.

The coat rack works wonderful for us, we hang our robes (tend to be thick and heavy) before going into the hot tub.  It was very easy to assemble, lightweight, yet it holds the robesas one expects a coat rack to do.  I don't understand the reviews that indicated difficulty assembling or trouble with its stability, none of that is the case for us.

We have been looking for a reasonable priced armoire for a while.  This piece is very sturdy and adds so much elegance to our living room.  The instructions for assembly were easy to follow, however it did take my husband and I about 4 hours to put it together. It is well worth the time and money we put into it. I love it!!!

I bought this because it was on sale and I wanted to try it. Now I want to kick myself for not getting it sooner. This is a gaget worth having. My husband even loves it. It makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze. It gets plenty of use and it still going strong. It is very user friendly and so easy to empty.

This set is so versatile.  I bought these because I own the red Le Creuset cookware and they matched them.  I thought that I would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard, but the longer I own them the more uses I find for them! Great for appetizer containers, for making mini casseroles (or quiches), creme brulee, serving soup, I've even baked mini bread loaves in them!  The only recommendation I have is to buy two sets--I usually end up using four at a time instead of two.

The turquoise place setting is beautiful...It is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com...Fiestaware is functional, calssic and fun- I love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this.  I highly recommend mixing and matching Fiestaware. I mix up colors that you wouldn't normally expect to go together and they usually look great

I had all but given up hope on electric can openers until I bought this one. You can tell when you pick it up that it's of good quality (not cheap, plastic junk). The removeable head is also very solid/heavy duty, and washes easily in the dishwasher. The black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter, as well. I'm a believer again in electric can openers

Have to disagree with the other reviewer here ...  I purchased a Baby biOrb recently for my new Betta, after having my first betta living in an airless bowl for a couple years.  I simply got tired of cleaning a stinky bowl every week. As a result, I went shoppin for a new tank with a bubbler and filter system and found the Baby biOrb.
  
While I agree that the maintence costs are significant at $132/ year (if you need to change a filter every 4 weeks), the costs balance with ease of maintenance.  Personally, my experience with cleaning the Baby biOrb was a snap with the optional suction hose.  Took me fifteen minutes to clean the tank, drain the grimey water and add new water.  Couldn't have been much easier.  And, I am not sure how anyone could have a problem swapping filter cartriges unless they have motor skills issues.

I also built a noise dampening box for the air pump - my only real complaint is that the "whisper quiet" pump sounds like a mini jackhammer after about five minutes.

Great product and looks awesome.

I bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon. It's a beautiful print, and a good color that matches my drapes, but what I didn't quite understand at the time I bought it was that it's also just one big piece of fabric. No fitted edges, or elastic to hold it in place - kind of disappointing. But since I was covering a futon, I was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds, shove a wooden dowel into the crease, and voila! a great looking couch appeared.
So, all things considered, a pretty good buy for the money

I own Reidel as well as Spieglau.  The differences are slight.  The Spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft/feel to them is very good.  And, given the price, if I break one I don't get upset as I would with a Reidel.  No wonder Reidel bought the company.  I recommend the Spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive, well made glass, at a moderate price.  Anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more, as these do, deserve to be recommended

I forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles, but mostly they ignored it.  When I got the battery, and the bird started moving, my two older cats weren't impressed, but my youngest (about 1 1/2 years) went crazy.  It's pretty funny watching her with the toy; she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird.  It's also entertaining when she's finished playing; she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly, which means she is hit in the backside by the bird.  Naturally, this starts the fight with the bird all over again.  I'm pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well, but even if it's just the kitten, it's worth the money

We have 2 Airedale Terriers (55-lb dogs) and 2 cats.  I originally bought a scat-mat as a deterrent to the cats, but it has since become a dog deterrent.  One of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we're not at home.  This is the only deterrent that has proven effective.  It keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down (as she'll keep getting shocked if she stands there).

I feel comfortable using the product, as I have been shocked by it many times myself (generally I step on it by accident in the middle of the night).  Make no mistake, it hurts, and you don't want to have it happen, but it certainly isn't bad enough that I feel cruel using it.

This is my second scat mat, as the other one stopped working.  Because of that, I'm a bit concerned about the durability, especially considering the cost.  That said, however, the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last (no wires going to the battery that may become detached), so I am hopeful that this one will last longer.  Either way, however, it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money.

This is a countertop friendly, cordless espresso maker that makes great coffee when you use an espresso grind for the coffee.  The auto shut-off makes it foolproof, and it is made of stainless steel, so no off tastes.  I think it is great

ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months, and it is fun, weve already gone through a cleary water filter. our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy, and its fully programmable. i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos, as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth, dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon, water it down or add skim for a really nice froth.  i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso, but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime.  So far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me. i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past.  I should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small, if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides, i would buy it

After spending $5-$10 a day at Starbucks, my wife and I got the Jura-Capresso for the convenience of a fully automatic machine and having fresh latte's at home in the morning.

We have used it for over 3 months now, and like it more and more each week.  The espresso, latte's, and cappucino's are wonderful, having to touch one button to have everything done at once is so easy, but perhaps the best part is the self cleaning it does.  About once a week you clean out a tray and refill the water...that's pretty much it!  Desserts like affogato (espresso on top of ice cream) are a just too easy to make now!

Downsides:  

-If you ever plan to reduce your caffeine consumption, this machine is not for you.  My wife and I both drink more coffee now because it is so good and so convenient.

-If you like really hot latte's the steamed milk won't get hot enough.  I'd call it very warm or slightly hot.  Just right for drinking but by the end it can be kind of cool.  Warm up the glass with the hot water option before fixes the problem.  Espresso, coffee, and even cappucino's come out at a perfect temperature

I love this little coffee maker.  I have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but I have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum.  This maker is made from stainless steel, which is more expensive, but for me it's worth it (as it will probably last a lifetime.)  It makes a very good cup of coffee and I'm very happy with it.
Also, the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent

I have had many different kinds of wine openers...Screwpull, rabbits etc...and nothing compares to the ease of this Cork Pop!  I have the "Legacy" version.  Nice looking and takes less than 10 seconds to remove the foil and open the bottle...no kidding (okay...I haven't really timed it...).  This would be great for someone with arthritic hands as there is no pulling or tugging involved...not even to remove the cork from the opener...just twist and the cork is removed.  It is really the most amazing opener ever!  The only downside I can think of is you will have to have cartridge refills eventually...I received mine about a month ago and have opened about 15 bottles of wine and still have plenty of "juice" left in the cartridge.  AWESOME

It's true, you have to put the whole silly thing together yourself.  But that is why it is the price it is.  Once put together, it is lightweight and easy to move to where you want it.  I recommend putting it together on a hard surface.  We used a piece of plywood.  When you try to put it together on carpet, the mallet doesn't enough force to make it work right

This is the best book light EVER.  My only issue is the battery life, but I fall asleep and leave it on all night sometimes.  The pages are illuminated very well and it's easy to use.  Makes a great book mark, too.  Don't let what I said about the batteries influence you not to buy.  I have both sizes.  I'm rough on them and I've had no problems.

I like the fact that it included diff sized containers, and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot. I have read reviews where people have burned out their motors, and I will have to say that, yes, it's possible, but only if you didn't follow the directions. The manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient, expect to shake things up once in a while between blends, and this unit should last you at least a year :D I think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it's thang. Gee, if that was the case, I'd let my car drive me on auto pilot.

I have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than $30 a month! After we purchased this water filter, I can tell there's little difference between the water I buy at the store and the water from this filter.  I also feel confident if my daughters drink it because I know they're not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water! 
I recommend this filter.

Edit 4/6/05:  Still using it, still like new, almost 3 years of almost daily use later.  Can't beat Wusthof

This little gadget is simple & cheap but you'd have to spend a lot more money to get a cup of coffee out of an electric coffee maker of the quality you get using this. Get some really high quality coffee beans, grind'em at home, use about one and a half scoops into your paper filter (using a small Gevalia-type scoop), take about 3 minutes (or less) to slowly pour your boiling water over the coffee grounds and you'll have a truly satisfying cup of hot coffee, right up there with French Press quality of flavor, but hotter. I've used the same beans in my Krups Moka Brew and they tasted awful then made the coffee using this, and it made a really flavorful cup of coffee. Highly recommended you try this before spending beaucoups of dollars on the high-end coffee brewers. Of course, if you're serving/entertaining folks, you'll need your standard coffee brewer but for making great, restaurant-quality coffee one cup at at time, this is a nice little product to have.

I purchased the eureka filter bags with the eureka upright Boss 4870GZ for my mom.   She loves them both.  The cord is really long on the vacuum which makes it easy to do several rooms at a time.  She lives in a one level ranch so she does not have to go up steps with it, because she does find it a bit heavy.  Beware the vacuum had to be assembled upon arrival.  I live out of state and she had to get another relative to help her assemble it. The add never mentioned that small detail!  Someone over 65 should not have to assemble a gift vacuum! I bought the Hoover Wind Tunnel 2 years ago, for myself and it's a peice of garbage. The lever to keep it upright broke, the attachments fall off the hose when in use and everthing gets tangled on the roller!  I am thinking about purchasing the Eureka soon, for myself! I reccomend it

As stated before in many a review, this machine is the best deal for the money. Paired with a real espresso grinder (which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself) this machine is capable of producing real espresso. My father bought this for me for my birthday back in December, and the machine is still in working condition.

My only real beef with this machine is the wand. I can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher, however, the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off. Right into my milk. I have taken to using the wand without either of them on, but this isn't optimum for latte foam. 

The only other thing that bothers me is that I have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead. This is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing. But I'd rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra $300 for something in stainless steel. 

All in all, the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time I use it. Woohoo.

I have only had it for a few days, but moving up from a Krups Pump system with only 1050W of heating, this unit rocks!

It used to take me about 10 minutes to make a latte with the Krups, as it took FOREVER to heat uo and never made enough steam.

This unit heats VERY fast and makes fantastic steam for the frother, which works fantastic, minus the complaint everyone has, the frother is WAY TO LOW TO THE GROUND, they fixed this with the Evolution model.

WATCH THE VIDEO!  The tamping and normal uses need to be followed very closely.  I HAVE to use the perfect crema device to make crema, which it does great.

THis unit also can be used to heat water for tea in like 2 mins, which is pretty cool.  You just fire up the unit. Wait till it heats, then flip the ESPRESSO switch, not the steam switch, with the steam adjuster already open, then hot water comes from the frother and BOOM...tea!

The drip tray is worthless, and is supposedly fixed in the Evolution model.

But for $200 this machine is AMAZING...very professional level equipment.

The ABS shell is pretty flimsy, but if it stays on the counter, which mine does, it will be fine...I don't need to spend another $300 for the stainless model...even though I would if I has a nicer kitchen just so it matched...(I rent but still have really nice appliances).

I got this gift from my husband I love the machine it so easy to use. I read so many other and I was afraid I was not going to get the machine and go buy my normal coffee but I bought the coffe, syrups and much more just to make them like the coffee shop was easy. The only thing I don't like is the height of th cup area or the noise. I had to go purchase other cups and them dump it into my bigger cups. They do offer you to buy a attachment for the bigger cups.

This is wonderful.  I have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid, but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me.  I actually enjoy working with this.  The only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer, but using really good litter, and not too much of it stops that.  I told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this

This is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes. I've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades (currently a 6 quart Rival Smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals), but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space & aren't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities. This little crockpot, however, is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew. I originally bought it, however, because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings, especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop, such as steel-cut oatmeal (try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once (also available here at Amazon) & you're unlikely ever to return to instant or "quick cook" oatmeal again). There is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen & knowing that a healthy, delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you. From mid-October to late-March, virtually every night I prepare my entire family's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot, with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave.

Other uses we've discovered: it's perfect for making & serving hot mulled cider; keeping hot dips, gravies & warm sauces & syrups heated on the buffet; as a substitute fondue pot; & for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient (how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup!). For single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space, this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker, especially if used in conjunction with Rival's inexpensive SP100-PDQ Smart-Part Module (also sold on Amazon as of the date of this review), which provides the same timed-cooking controls that are integrated with many of Rival's larger, more expensive crockpots.

The energy used is minimal, too -- only 80 watts -- & the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher, as does the lid, for very convenient clean-up

Very nice smooth feel but all the bowls look slightly different, the slight inconsistancys make you feel like you have a set of hand-made set!

When I adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago, two of my good friends highly recommended Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter. Here's why--

This Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter is excellent for your favorite kitty's litter box. The company states that it is very good at absorbing odors--and, by golly, it's TRUE! The odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat. Moreover, I really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box. That's a plus for any cat lover!

If you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend, not surprisingly, that you use more cat litter in the box. Otherwise, if you have just one cat, two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine. You should change the entire litter box once a week on average. (I change mine about twice a week just for my cat's comfort.)

It's also a good idea to scoop out any "kitty remains" every other day or so. Be very certain NOT to flush any "kitty presents" down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this. I suppose it could clog toilet pipes. Moreover, as you may suspect, any "kitty leftovers" could have some nasty germs that we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any "kitty presents" with a scooper.

The fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any "kitty presents," thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box. Nevertheless, I recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week. Place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage.

In short, this is a great cat litter product at a great price. The contents of the bag last a long time, especially if, like me, you have only one cat. The manufacturer also offers customers (us, not the cats) an "awards" program with points that you can accumulate in your "account" with the company on the company Internet website. A nice plus! 

OK, Fresh Step--I thank you; my father and mother thank you; and, most importantly, my CAT says THANK YOU !!!      SMILES

Now, I don't know whether you are a die-hard Hello Kitty fan or not, but you gotta have this! The numerous different settings, the awesome design, and the fact that it's HELLO KITTY makes it worth it's weight in gold. I had been looking for one of these cheap and I ended up getting one for the holidays! So that worked well. These toasters are cheap as they come online here, so grab em and go! Good luck if ya get one! (*the hello kitty waffle maker and juicer rock too!

This machine replaces a semiautomatic Delonghi, which, I thought, was decent.  Well...after using this for 3 weeks, I can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent.  The Titanium is a wonderful machine.  Not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great.  It's fully programable and, once set, it's just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso - every time!  It warms up in UNDER A MINUTE, has a large bean hopper, large water resevior, very cool blue lcd display...i can't rave enough.  I've had no problems at all with this machine and I recommend it heartily

* Purchased at PetSmart
* Seems to work well
* Very quiet when operating properly
* Took our cats a little over a week to get used to it
* The flow isn't very good when the setting is low.  We keep it at medium.
* I clean it out about once a week. Cat hair from our medium-haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well

We  love these glasses, we have had the Reidel glasses, like these, many times. . . they break so easily and can't go in the dishwasher. These glasses are so much more utilitarian, we use them as our everyday glasses, not just for wine. They look great, feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher, and cost so much less.  We still keep the Reidel on hand for special occasions, they are more refined, but I got so tired of that ultra-thin glass breaking in my hand as I attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass. 
I strongly recommend the Libbey glasses . . . You will like it, like, like it on your table, table, table

I bought these molds for my Crystal Light drinks so that I could have a more nutritious dessert option. The molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money. The plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable. Make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom, impossible to get back out, and the taste will go with it. I have fun using these and they were reasonably priced

This is the fourth piece of furntiure I have bought from this line (mission, natural). I love it.  I have a bookcase and two tables that originally were for a computer work center, but use them as night-stands.  It fits my 1950's contemporary home perfectly.  Price is great.  Delivery even better.  I ordered on a Saturday night and received it by Tuesday noon.  I couldn't ask for more.

I've found the Omron very easy and practical to use.  It gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and BMI (body mass index) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program.  For the money, it would be difficult to find something better

I've been using the Omron HBF-306 Body Fat Analyzer for a month or so now. So far I've been very impressed with its consistency. However, I would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the Omron's measurements to see how accurate it is. It's well built and very easy to use. Once you set up your profile, it only takes a few seconds to get a read. I would give it 5 stars but again I dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with. Still a good product at a good price.

I bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where I was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that I could get a reality check on my activity levels.  I opened the box, read the easy directions, set up my personal step measurement (just measure off the distance of your 10 steps), and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day.  I was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me! Over the next 6 days, (this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you); I literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with NO aerobic exercise on day 1, to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3! Every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 "normal" steps, and increasing the aerobic steps too (which are tracked separately). I can press the mode button, check out how many miles my steps translate to, kilocalories burned, aerobic steps, and compare it with the past 7 days as well. It has turned out to be even more fun than what I originally bought it for. I actually feel better, and the fun part is that I am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day! This has been an eye-opening experience for me, and I keep this on or in my pocket all the time now, just to make sure I keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day

Great features!  Probably the best pedometer out there for the money.  The only reason I give 4 vice 5 stars, is that I think the one I bought for my mom (same brand and model) is slightly more accurate.  A great way to track your fitness overall

I really like these things.  They're certainly chewy, so they can be a bit of a jaw workout, but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar, and they keep you going for a couple of hours.  If only they were a little cheaper, say a dollar or less per bar, I'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than I do right now

I was really enjoying my Oregon Scientific Pedometer, I found it easy to use and accurate; however, after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor, and that was it, it no longer works...I will probably buy another one, but it needs to be treated with kid-gloves.

I still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works!  this one works even better I have tried other remington shavers over the years  the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the  first one untill now! I found that by shaving in small circular motion  as  you move along your face you won't need williams lectric shave as I had with the other razors and it's much easier to claen! now if the just keep making replacement baldes I will be very happy for a long time

I bought this product because I had a borderline high reading at my doctor's office.  Rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop-pay just to have it monitored, we purchased this unit.  It works wonderful.  Very simple and gives more information than I expected

This is very easy to use and quite convenient. I'm not sure, however, how accurate this monitor is. It seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times. The value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically. THen it's a warning to go to the doctor's

This has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use.  It really doesn't start until your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping when you've got it right.  The display is large and easy to read and understand.  I definitely would recommend this

Very happy with this purchase. Received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [...] credit card. It is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors. I like the History feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily!Good machine especially since it has an AC adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently!Also, the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings

I just finished a 4 day golf tournament that was brutal. 6 hour rounds played in 90 degree heat with high humidity. During a practice round a couple of days before the tournament started I really got drained of energy after about 12 holes. I was unprepared and it made a sport that I normally enjoy into an unpleasant experience.

For the tournament rounds I packed a small cooler with Gatorade, Nature Valley Fruit and Nut bars, and chocolate flavored Clif Builder's bars. I drank water and gatorade throughout each round and alternated the bars every 3-4 holes. It really made a difference. Each day I felt like I had the energy and endurance for a great round. If only my golf game was as good as these bars.

They tasted great and keeping them in a cooler kept them from melting in the heat. I highly recommend Chocolate Clif Builder's bars.

These bars are absolutely fantastic. They are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein (20g). They taste pretty good, far better than most bars. I prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor. Out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream, next being the peanut butter, and then chocolate. A chocolate mint flavor has just been released but I have yet to try it. I recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out

Just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived MELTED as noted by another reviewer. I ended up placing in the fridge, and then taking out before eating. Turns out, I didn't find them that great directly from the fridge. Also, they just didn't taste as fresh as the ones I buy individually from Wal-Mart. I couldn't tell if that was because they had melted, or just weren't as fresh to start with

I originally ordered a Tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks.  (Amazon, of course, took it back with no problems.)  I was so glad when the Omron scale arrived.  It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much higher.  The numbers on it are very large and easy to read.  Also, it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita.  I can't wait to try all the features.  By the way, I weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as promised.  Great deal for the money!!!

I recently started Weight Watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale.  I figured I would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the Omron scale.  I am very pleased with this product.  It has been extremely accurate.  It keeps a history for both my husband and I.  I would highly recommend this scale to anyone!  It is also an attractive scale which is a bonus.  Go with the Omron scale

After reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar, and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market.

The Cherry Covered Choccolate Luna Bars are quite tasty. Chances are, if you're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar, you  need a little enticement to eat healthy. Like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day. I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect). That helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop

This monitor is so easy to use, and more convenient than going to the grocery store. It saves the readings in memory, so if I don't have a pen and paper handy, I can retrieve the info later. It even shows the time the reading was taken.

My wife had high BP, so we got this model.  The reasons for choosing this model were that:
1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate
2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models
3. Omron seems to be one of the better/best brands.
4. Supposedly, the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking.

The unit appears well built (including the hand pump).  It is easy to operate, and it seems very accurate.  We checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home, and the automatic unit at the drug store.  We find it takes very accurate and consistent readings.

People with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient.  Also, people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff.  I'm overweight right now, so the cuff barely fits my arm, but fits my wife's nicely (it was bought for her)

My physician introduced me to this item. He said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods. Is affordable and easy to use. Oh, did I forget to mention, accurate compaired to a scale model I own. Amazon is great to order from, the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days!

I came across the Hooah drink because my boss--a retired military man running for office--always has a case lying around. With campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long, these are invaluable for getting me through the day, and keeping my thoughts coherent. Apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent. I can't measure that in myself of course, but I do sense a dramatic improvement

This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in. It isnt carbonated, and tastes really good.

What I really wanted to know though, was how it worked. There is no caffeine or taurine, and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary.

It worked well though, and I was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it

I have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and I find it to be accurate, but it takes a while for it to give a reading. The first few times I used it, it took over a minute to tell me my pulse. However, the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster. So far, this is true, as within the last 3 days, I have received readings within 10 seconds consistently. Considering the price, it was a good purchase

If you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback, this is the product to buy. Packaging, support, presentation, and hardware/software quality are the best that I have seen.  No down side. It's not a game in the usual sense. More of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way.

There is room for a little mischief. Instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly, I tried busting a few. Type A personality shows through occasionally. I will be purchasing the next item in the series. I am learning to relax, at will, which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation. Good luck

Philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards.

Most of the low price AED's use camaera batteries. My defibrillator has a long life lithium battary.

I won't risk someone's life on store-bought battaries.

As an ER/Trauma nurse I have seen and been involved in many, many cardiac arrests. Here is some information that you need to know 1) You must still perform adequate CPR, if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain! 2) Even with trained personnel, CPR, a defibrillator and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (medications) the survival rate is very, very low.
I am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this AED it is a wonderful unit I have been trained on it and had to use it once. I am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over $1000 on a defibrillator (especially for a private home)then a good idea would be to spend another $50 and take a basic CPR class. I hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it!!

At church today I came upon a man who had partially collapsed.  Since I'm a physician, I stopped and offered aid.  It turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms.  To my dismay, we do not have an AED at our church (yet).  We notified 911, and he was taken for medical care without any problems, but I was a bit worried there for a few minutes.  While I'm trained in BLS, that is, at best, a temporizing measure.  AEDs have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms.  In my opinion, places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices.  I'll be working with our church to see if we can get one.  I would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for EMS if I had had one of these today.

However, buying an AED is not a cure-all.  I have been trained on these, and they are very simple to learn to use.  However, I think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest.  If you are considering buying an AED for home or public use, I strongly suggest reading the section on AEDs at the American Heart Association website.  It discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device.

So, while not for everyone, this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives.  In the right situation, it is indispensable.

As an Emergency Nurse Practitioner and Paramedic, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting electricity to an adult who is suffering from cardiac arrest.  Technology is moving quickly to get electricity to the cardiac arrest victim earlier and earlier -- and the survival rates AND quality of life rates after such an arrest are sky rocketing accordingly.

Is there too much direct-to-consumer marketing by medical-related companies?  Probably.  Is your personal risk for experiencing sudden cardiac arrest per calendar year low?  Definitely.  ...but do those smug reviewers refuse to buy vehicles with airbags in them just because their risk of being in an accident is low and the direct-to-consumer marketing is irritating to them?  No!  Those will be the same folks who want their cars with anti-lock breaks, airbags, the best side-impact reinforcements... and being a good driver (ie, "just improve your diet") won't cancel their risk for being in an accident.

I hope you never have to use this machine, but as an emergency healthcare worker -- both pre-hospital and in the emergency room -- I cannot say enough positive about AED's in the community setting!

Don't run out and purchase this out of paranoia, however if yuo are at risk for a sudden cardiac event consider if this would be appropriate for you, your family members, your apartment building, your church, etc.  ...and rest assured that it is absolutely safe -- it is impossible to hurt a loved one with this, you can only help.

...and to those who gave negative reviews on this AED?  Don't forget to pay your car insurance!..

The toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads. If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer. The Oral B head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth, you can. I have not had a cavity in years. My pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed. If only these woked on abs.

This baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure. We're yet to verify what the culprit is... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch.

I would highly recommend this guy if you're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor. It's been consistant, reliable, and informative for both myself and my doctor

I'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I've finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I've finally found the right one.

I've used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They've gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don't work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2PM.

So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.

My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I've ever tried.  Highly recommended

I mean come ON, who needs 5 blades right?

Well, after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the Mach III was over a twin head razor, I decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so I took the plunge, and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations.

The first thing I noticed was that this new Fusion has a more powerful engine than the Mach III. The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore. And I find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about. But I do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what I mean. haw haw 5 Blade

We LOVE this item!!!  We get older TV show DVDs from Netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come.  If the cleaner doesn't work, and it generally does, our back up is the repair stuff, which almost always does.  I think out of 30 disks, only two were not fixed.

I was surprised to open this pedometer page after sometime and see all the negative reviews it receives. I have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now and I am really satisfied with it. It is really accurate (&lt;1% declination, I have performed more than four tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life and I have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much worse), clips firmly to belt or pants, displays the time conveniently and has nice backlight, even has a radio which works, although as most people said, not really its best feature. The truth is that I am not using the radio at all, mostly because I believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to Walmart. But I have tested it and it works, although nothing impressive there. Of course, for the money, I think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer.

One funny comment is that, although most people complain it cannot open very easily, after sometime it will open more easily that you think. Actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake, will open it wide, so it does not count any steps. But it does not open by itself anyway, needs external force for this to happen, so it does not happen often.

All in all, I am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews. Maybe I have been lucky, maybe not, but this has been one of the best and most reliable devices that I carry and use every day. And a great incentive for walking and exercising more

This book is beautiful outside, I love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front. What I do not like is how there is no specific places to write in, you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page..too much like scrapbooking for me, I wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in..For example one blank page will say, "All About Mom" then another that says "Baby Shower" etc..but the pages are blank.

We use the ZBars for breakfast, and my kids love them! I love them too, as they're organic, contain no trans fat, no refinded sugar or flour. They're yummy AND healthy

This is one of the best-tasting energy/snack bars I've tried.  It has true flavors (think a chewy chocolate brownie with small chocolate chips), little or no "off" flavors or aftertastes, and it's relatively filling, especially if accompanied by water or an additional quick snack, such as fruit.  It's a small bar, but it's packed with 3 grams of fiber (12% of daily needs based on a 2,000 calorie diet), and it's certified 95% organic.  These organic ingredients include organic rolled oats, organic oat Flour, organic oat fiber, organic and milled flaxseed, and actual natural flavors.  Even the sweet stuff is organic:, including organic chocolate (made with--you guessed it--organic evaporated cane juice), soy butter, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, tapioca syrup, and fig paste. CLIF's website proclaims that  "CLIF ZBar is the first kids' snack created to comply with SB-19, California's Senate Bill limiting fat and sugar in foods offered within the state's school system...We source ingredients which do not contain wheat and are not genetically engineered."  Although aimed at kids, adults and teens will enjoy this as well.

Ingredients: Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Chocolate Chips (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors), Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Syrup, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Fig Paste, Organic Oat Flour, Organic Cocoa Powder, Organic Soy Butter, Natural Flavors, Organic Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Organic Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin), Salt, Baking Soda. For those with allegies, CLIF includes the following caution "Contains soy. May contain traces of milk, peanuts and other nuts."

Vitamins & Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), Niacinamide (Vit. B3), Ferric Orthophosphate (Iron), Zinc Oxide, Cyanocobalamin (Vit. B12), Thiamine Mononitrate (Vit. B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vit. B6), Riboflavin (Vit. B2), Folic Acid (Vit. B9), Beta Carotene (Vit A).

Nutritional Information: In one bar (36 grams) there are 120 calories, 3 grams of fat (5% of percent daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet), of which one gram s saturated fat(but no trans fat), 0 cholesterol, 12 grams sugar, A total of 22 grams carbohydrates (7%), which includes 12 grams of sugar and 10 grams of other carbohydrates, 125 mg of sodium (4%), 110 mg. potassium(3%), 3 grams of dietary fiber (12%) and a gram of insoluble fiber, and the following vitamins and minerals:  Vitamin A (6%), B1(30%), B2 (15%), B3 (20%), B6 (20%), B12 (10%), %). C (35%), Iron (10%), zinc (15%), Phosphorus (20%), and Folate (20%).


I don't think there's a similar product around that can compete with the taste, purity, and nutritional value of this popular new treat

I still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works!  this one works even better I have tried other remington shavers over the years  the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the  first one untill now! I found that by shaving in small circular motion  as  you move along your face you won't need williams lectric shave as I had with the other razors and it's much easier to claen! now if the just keep making replacement baldes I will be very happy for a long time

This Omron Blood Pressure Monitor is OK, but not as good, in my opinion as my old one from the same company.  This one doesn't print out results, although it does store them.  Also, the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome.

I came across the Hooah drink because my boss--a retired military man running for office--always has a case lying around. With campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long, these are invaluable for getting me through the day, and keeping my thoughts coherent. Apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent. I can't measure that in myself of course, but I do sense a dramatic improvement

I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews.  One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients.  This is untrue.  Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar.  The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash.  Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine.  Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.

Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more sugar.  It has less.  One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of sugar.  The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar.  The same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar.

Finally, the support for the troops is not marketing hype.  Our company is partnered with the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center.  A portion of the gross proceeds from each can of HOOAH! Soldier Fuel and each HOOAH! bar directly funds research that improves the safety, diet, and quality of life of our troops

Very happy with this purchase. Received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [...] credit card. It is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors. I like the History feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily!Good machine especially since it has an AC adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently!Also, the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings

For many years I Couldn't use a electric shaver because it was always a incomplete shave, so after each Christmas when I received a new one I would try it and would go back to a manual razor, THEN came along the freeglider and yippy it did a reasonable job that I would call satisfactory, the over the years That razor went obsolete so I started to look for a new replacement. I read some of the reviews. I read "the refills are costly  ... hello... 4$ a month?, then I read doesn't do a good job, Well let me report to you all this is the best darn razor, Its like magic each time I use it(cleans itself each time" its quick, comfortable , quiet, the cleaning process is so cool and I for one love the concept of a clean razor each time I use it, this razor is 10 times better then the freeglider which I loved, what a joy shaving now is , I can even shave twice (I go to work sometimes at 3am then later that night if I'm going out I can shave again and it doesn't irritate.. what a magical razor they have designed ..

PS. The cleaning solution is not expensive (under 12$ for 3ea, that's 4$ apiece and lasts a month).

thank you to the designer

I highly recommend this  2 thumbs up

cons

none I can see as yet .. John

Nowhere else in this country can you get this quality, accuracy and convenience at this price.  FDA Approved and NCEP Certified, and the entire cholesterol panel... no other at-home test can make those claims.  As for my results, they agreed perfectly with the lab test at my doctor's office.  Why would anyone want to waste time at their doctor's office when Amazon.com makes this superb BIOSAFE test available to any customer.  I'm recommending it to all my friends.  Buy one today!  Or better yet 2; get one for a friend

My wife and I have used this a few times now and really like it.  From a novice's point of view, this is a great meditation aid.  I like being able to get the visual feedback as I calm and center myself.  I guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as I try to accomplish the task in front of me.

It's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack

This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone.  The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use!  Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments).

That said the interface etc. needs help, it can be downright frustrating, and the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens.  Thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack Wisdom Quest, which I also highly recommend.  Overall, this is a really innovative and great product.  Also a good investment as far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more expansion packs and third-party software to come

I finally received this product in the mail after knowing about it for a year. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Deepak Chopra. He presents some good ideas, but from what I can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a mechanism for mind and body control, leading to bliss and relaxation, rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge, to come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore. I find this bias is reflected in the game.
 As a game in itself, it is pretty good -  its graphics and its originality - and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people. I didn't find the process as compelling as I expected, though. I found I was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast, and other places I seemed to get stuck. One potential drawback is that if you get frustrated, and try to start forcing things to happen, it can defeat the purpose of meditation.
The science of biofeedback is fairly new, and I can see its potential in the field of preventative health. I just wouldn't put the same New Age spin on things as Chopra does.

You can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk, though  it takes some patience to get things really smooth. I've used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems. My skin was a little sensitive after the first time, but no terrible pain or anything, and there's none at all now that I'm accustomed to using it. It is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving, but if you read the instructions first you should be fine. A couple of very minor drawbacks: It's rather noisy, more so than a regular electric razor, and if you use the comb attachments, it's tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time. But that pops right back in, so not a big dea

This is a very good shaver for the private area.  However, the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first.  This will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work.  The foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long.

The only problem I had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed.  However, I use the 'mangroomer' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle.  it is a great product as well.

Therefore, I would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men's grooming on the body.  I would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results

Yes, the kit is easy to use, but if you don't bleed freely, get a few extra lancets before you start. Most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free. The kit only comes with two (which can be used only one time). It took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test; I had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets (because I'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool). Other than that - no complaints. The lab got the results back to me faster than expected

These bars are supposed to be for Women because they are lower cal and have more calcium.  I think there are other factors as well.  Men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough, but they say that they need calcium and protein too.  I really like the key lime flavor it is great.  I like lemon also and the chi tea.  I like those flavors because they are light tasting and I do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do.  The lime reminds me of the florida keys.  These are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out I did not eat another man ciff bar.  I used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when I had a busy life.  Thankfully my life has slowed down now.  It is good grab and go food

After reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar, and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market.

My daughter Morgane, who is now 8 years old, has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy (yes, there is such a thing, unfortunately).
The symptoms are very impressive, she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes. She cannot move or open her eyes. It makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to "get dizzy". We tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down, to no avail. Morgane's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines, and we try to avoid giving Morgane medication as she is so young. So I thought of using RESPeRATE as my Dad has high-blood pressure and I knew it worked on the breathing pattern.

Morgane immediately understood how to use the device, it was so easy and even fun for her. It relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines. Her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far, she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months. She used to have them every two months.

I have purchased another device for my best friend, a long time migraine sufferer. The way I see it, it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing

This baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure. We're yet to verify what the culprit is... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch.

I would highly recommend this guy if you're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor. It's been consistant, reliable, and informative for both myself and my doctor

I have had Omord HR-100C for a few months now. I use it wile on my treadmill. It seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate; I think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin. I did have some trouble with the unit when I first started using it; I replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem. The fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons I picked the Omord brand. The HR-100C is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor

Great product for the $ I spent.  I picked it b/c I can replace the batteries myself and the cost was in my budget.  It does jump around more than I'd like, but I can tell from the range that I am over or under my target heart rate.  It does beep to let you know that, but I find it annoying so I turn it off.  If you find you have trouble getting it to register your rate, then move it around a bit.  Mine works best when I put it higher on my chest, in the area of my heart, just below my shoulder blade.

This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet.

The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.

Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination.

Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.

Enjoy life

Now that I'm writing this review, it seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush.  But I am.  I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive).  Growing up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done.

After the root canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations, because that's what she'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums.  This specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable.  When I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums.  It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth.  Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don't remember if she has this exact model, but ours are similar), and I've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I purchased it.

As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from "gunking" up, I'm the only person who uses this item, so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not dripping into the storage container; so I don't know how to combat that.  But I just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it, then rinse the hand-held part, and set them back on the unplugged charger/base (I only plug it in when the battery runs low) and things stay clean with no problem

I recently started Weight Watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale.  I figured I would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the Omron scale.  I am very pleased with this product.  It has been extremely accurate.  It keeps a history for both my husband and I.  I would highly recommend this scale to anyone!  It is also an attractive scale which is a bonus.  Go with the Omron scale

My wife had high BP, so we got this model.  The reasons for choosing this model were that:
1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate
2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models
3. Omron seems to be one of the better/best brands.
4. Supposedly, the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking.

The unit appears well built (including the hand pump).  It is easy to operate, and it seems very accurate.  We checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home, and the automatic unit at the drug store.  We find it takes very accurate and consistent readings.

People with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient.  Also, people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff.  I'm overweight right now, so the cuff barely fits my arm, but fits my wife's nicely (it was bought for her)

I eat one of these twice a week before I play ice hockey.  I specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine, though I don't perceive any "boost".  It could be there and I'm just not noticing it.  I feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout.  It would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the Clif Bar.
I find the size of a Clif bar a bit disappointing, especially considering the "store" price of $1.50.  At $11 a case and with free shipping when spending $25 or more, I've not found a better price than Amazon's on Clif bars

I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down.  As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  Highly recommende

If you burn lots of calories in your activities, this high energy food could give you a lift.  There are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar, which is advertised to be at least 70% organic.  This bar is advertised to be for athletes first, and as a casual snack second.  If you are overweight and trying to drop pounds, you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn.

When I opened this bar I noticed that it looks like compressed goop.  However, the compressed goop tastes pretty good.  The texture is much like a granola bar, though more moist than a granola bar.  The black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated.  There are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor, which is a big plus.  I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial, which is an even bigger plus.

One thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy.  I guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process.  In either case, vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product.  The label also states that there may be traces of peanuts.

This bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber, which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar.  There are also lots of vitamins and trace elements, which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements, in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing.

Clif Bars could be a casual snack, but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities.  If you fall into that category, which could include hiking, climbing, bicycling, running, jogging, and other similarly strenuous activities, then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package.

Enjoy!

I really liked the outside design of the book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am pleased with it. I would most likely buy again

My physician introduced me to this item. He said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods. Is affordable and easy to use. Oh, did I forget to mention, accurate compaired to a scale model I own. Amazon is great to order from, the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days!

It does what it advertises. The bodyfat readings do fluctuate, but that's normal, it gives you a good general idea of how much bodyfat you have, and it gives a simple reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low, normal, high, too high. I got it for about 25 bucks so good buy.

I own an older dispensor, from around 1999, and I was afraid that these filters wouldn't fit.  They do and seem to work fine.  I can't find a "replace" indicator on these new ones, the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them.  I guess that I just have to replace it on a calendar basis, they say the filters are good for 2 months

I was very suprised at how small the units were (I ordered 2).  But they work great and run very quietly.  The filter is very easy to change.  I have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that I switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money

I called Nature Made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury. Their Fish oil is USP tested for purity and potency. There isn't any "mercury-free" fish oil, however, NM contains only .01 mcg / g of mercury. Very low level and certainly not toxic. I'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently. FYI: they have a great website that contains all this information

Doug Ritter and his foundation, Equipped to Survive, has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit. It is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket, yet fully functional.

Although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit (something of a rite of passage among the survivalists/emergency preparedness folk), I spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit. The military issue sparklite and tinder-quick, Fox-40 whistle, and Rescue Flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear. This pack is extremely high quality through and through, from choice of equipment to packing and instructions. I recommend looking at the ETS website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what Doug Ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit (the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs).

The Pocket Survival Pack is an amazing value. I've purchased all of the items separately, and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost! If you are lucky enough to get everything at one store, you'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this. I know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits! That's how economical it is. Plus, if you buy this PSP, a portion of the proceeds goes to the ETS non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards. In fact, Doug Ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine, aviation, and remote travel.

The kit itself comes in a waterproof container. I found it to be a bit tight when closing back up, but there is actually some room for more items. All components are of the highest quality. It's lightweight and I never notice it in a pocket. With the recommended ETS or similar keychain LED flashlight and a good pocket folding knife, you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $100+. These are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping/hiking/marine/aviation gear you might have. I highly recommend this PSP. I'm not affiliated with ETS, but I've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums. And if this was a bad kit, I'd still say so. I give it 5 stars, great value for the price and it really could save your life

Bought this to help make muddy paw print clean up a little quicker.  This works well, my better half thinks I have an obsession with Mr. Swiffer... :) It does leave a haze on the floor though.  I use the recommended 3 sec. cleaner dispense...maybe it's because I don't change the pads ofter enough.  Overall, I would purchase the Swiffer again if I had too

I received this parfum as a birthday gift and I fell in love with it as soon as I smelled it.  The scent lasts all day without being too overbearing. I swear every single time I wear this, someone stops me and asks what am I wearing.  The fragrance is crisp and sensual.  It kind of reminds me of Bath & Body Works' Moonlight Path. Buy it, you won't regret it, especially for the price that Amazon is offering it for

These wipes are just as soft and durable as Pampers, but much less expensive! They are not alcohol-free, unfortunately - though I have noticed that those wipes which are alcohol-free contain citric acid (fyi). Quick, free delivery

I suffer from upper back and shoulder tension.  I've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one I had.  After looking at many warmers, I chose the Happy Wrap.  The wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles.  My Yorkshire Terrier can't wait until I'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when I'm finished.

I really like this product because it's compact and easy to use. Now that wouldn't be important if it didn't work properly, but it does, so I have everything in one small, easy-to-carry package.  That's a valuable feature for one who's on the go as much as I am.

The greatest thing about this product is that it's ACCURATE; I always take it to the Dr's office with me and compare his results with the results of this dynamite little monitor.

I liked it so well, after I tried it, I went back and bought one for a friend who was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure.

Highly recommended, but I also recommend that you compare your results with your doctor's.  After all, it's only a machine ... and like cars, you can always get a "lemon.

I have been using Source of Life Energy Shake for many years.  I recommend one scoop in 8 oz. of orange juice or milk twice a day.   Basically, I pour the milk in a shaker cup and put the scoop on top, close the shaker and shake for a few seconds.   This stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy vitamins, herbs, minerals, and more!     A few months ago, I actually used this drink to cut down on my Starbuck's daily double shot of expresso!   Guess a Source of Life Starbucks Latte would be great, maybe I'll try that someday!  This product deserves more than 5 stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way.   If you are looking for a healthy energy drink that tastes good, you have found it

My grandfather found a vial of Old Spice in his Navy kit when he joined in 1943. He continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age. I began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious: Old Spice is conservative and masculine, distinct and time-honored. It's not a trend; it's a statement of manhood. If Proctor &amp; Gamble obliges, my own grandkids will be using it

I love this product. In combination with diet and exercise I have lost about 5 pounds, and I wasn't heavy to begin with (all I wanted to do was tone up). Instead of taking the recommended dosage of 2 capsules twice a day, I am taking 1 twice a day. I figured I'd take it slow before I get too jittery. But it definitely curbs my appetite. I literally eat half of my usual intake. It gives me energy without making me feel like I'm wired and I haven't had any shaking hands. I only had headaches for the first 2 days I took this, but now they are completely gone. I will continue to take this even after I reach my goal weight. It's a great product.

I rate (Green tea Fat Burner) 5 star. because

I bot another called Lipoxinol 70.00) and I bot another one called   (Green tea fat furner) and it was better in quality wise and its only 14.99 at Costco.
Lipoxinol is very good as well but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its ( made canada) derctions say to take 4 pills in AM & 4pills  PM. and man there great.
the (green tea fat burners)  in comparison dictions say take 2 pillsAM & 2pills PM. I over rall I think  (green tea fat burner) makes me a little bit more hyper. the more hyper the more stuff I do ,that means the more excerise I get,,,,,
 You will see Lipoxinal on amazon. its 4 star, this one has less rating for some reason ,not many people said much about it, wierd ,Americans like to pay more money when ,this one can work just as great, not all work tho, but like I said this one was great for me in wise, I bot both,dont go off telling every one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get worryed, like theres no problem ,people drink Coffee every day of there life, I told my mom and she thot I was crazy, but what dose my mom know, she never tryed weight loss pills, I tryed ntoher one from the natral food store call Mini skiny fat burner and I felt like I just shot my self with cocane, so be carfull ,earbs have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug crazy,

This product does make the appetite disappear!! However it made me very irritable while I took it. I took it for four days so I did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked. The pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation. Everyone is affected differently when taking things so I would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away.

IT'S AMAZING HOW A LITTLE COMMON SENSE CAN TURN INTO A MILLION YOU KNOW WHAT'S. AS SOON AS I TRIED THESE I REALIZED HOW MUCH BETTER THEY ARE THAN THE USUAL THROAT LOZENGES. WHY? BECAUSE OTHERS CAUSE YOU TO SUCK ON THEM, AND THIS STRAINS YOUR THROAT MUSCLES, WHICH IS BAD. GUMMI LOZENGES, IT'S GENIUS. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT. THEN AGAIN, I DID, BUT I DIDN'T CREATE AIRBORNE WHICH IS WONDERFUL IN ITSELF. REALLY, THESE LOZENGERS ARE GREAT. AT NIGHT IF YOU USE ONE THEY JUST STAY PRETTY MUCH STUCK TO THE SIDE OF YOUR THROAT AND YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP WITHOUT EVEN THE THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD SHALLOW IT AND CHOKE. JUST REMEMBER HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR A NORMAL LOZENGE TO DISOLVE WITHOUT BITTING IT ( EVEN THEN ). THESE GO PRETTY QUICK, AND WITHOUT CREWING ( WHICH IS THE BEST WAY TO USE THEM ). I MYSELF TRY TO ALWAYS HAVE THEM IN THE HOUSE. YOU SHOULD, AND WILL DO THE SAME AFTER YOU TRY THEM. ALSO THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS THE BEST. I'M ABOUT TO ORDER 10 BOXES ( WOULD ORDER MORE BUT FOR THE SHIPPING CHARGE, WHICH EVEN WITH IS STILL CHEAPER THEN TARGET ). MAYBE THE OWNER SHOULD PUT ME ON THE PAYROLL.

27 ounces is a nice size, the bottle is light (can be dented), and water stored in it tastes very good....and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy!
Another reviewer mentioned a squeal......that would be while twisting the cap on or off. I've gotten used to that. Wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my Toyota cupholder...that may not be an issue with Toyotas that are newer than mine are (10 & 15years).
In the car, on the nightstand ,in the canoe or kayak.....it's working for me

I purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters.  It's a great brush head for pediatric (and adult) mouths. They swap out the heads, it's rechargeable and I can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down.  I have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build-up

I used to own a brush from another manufacturer.  It never brushed well: the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly.  I just never felt I was getting a good brush.

After using this brush for about a couple of months, I went in for a regular checkup.  My dentist told me my teeth had never looked better.  That's all the testimony I need

I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  The kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth.  It's a bit louder than the older model, probably because it's got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.

Overall, just what we wanted

I was skeptical about buying this at first, but after seeing it in Allure, and reading the various reviews on amazon, I decided to try it.
I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised; it does what it says. It won't work on cyctic acne or if the pimple has already come to a head. It does work on pimples that are just beginning.. those hard, tender knots deep under your skin you just know are going to be huge in a day or two. I've used it on two pimples that were red bumps, and both were mostly gone within 24 hours. Completely gone in less than 3 days. Usually it would have taken 7-10 days for them to go away, and it would have been UGLY

Heats up fast, rolls up easily (doesn't slip like old-school hot rollers used to), and stays on with the right hot roller clips. Depending on the look I'm looking for, I use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair, keep them on for 10 minutes while I put on my makeup, and voila! Soft, strokeable voluminous hair

Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style. I like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick, long hair. These rollers rock

The lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans from aquis are very soft, absorbant, and they dry quickly. The "diva darling" hair towels are not quite as nice.

Hair turbans stay neatly on your head and are more convenient than a big fluffy towel. If the turban gets sopping wet, that means it's doing its job!

My parents taught me it's impolite to come to breakfast without a towel covering my wet hair. This turban is not only great at home, but also in college dorms.

I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head

Great aerobic exerciser for the money and very lightweight.  Let cool down after using as metal does get a bit hot.  The plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit, yet the plastic will off-gas.  Works best on couch while watching TV/Movies.  For anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out, I highly recommend this to help get you back into shape

It truly delivers what it promises...frizz free,loose, non-stiff curls!  I just get out of the shower, towel dry very lightly, put it on and voila! Makes my curls looks sexy!

I just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday, I was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - I was surprised because I hadn't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air, when I realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry.  Like Seventh Generation's lavender laundry detergent, I love this product - if you use them in tandem, not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender (not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products), but they come out clean and soft.  I especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it's gentle enough to use on my baby's clothes, too!  I love that it's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil.  It's also safe for my septic system, so I'm sold on this product.  If you're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or can't find one that smells good to you, try this one!

This replaced a similar wrist cuff meter which I was not happy with.  The old meter would give very different readings on measurements made minutes apart.  This meter yields essentially the same numbers for second measurements.  Out of curiosity, I took it with me to my doctors office, used his large cuff (I have very large arms) and compared the readings to his equipment.  Total difference was about 3%, a quite acceptable tolerance for my home measurement.  Another reviewer was unhappy with the screen size and position on the bottom of the wrist.  If the unit is operated as shown in the instructions, the screen size and position are perfect, the unit is at heart level, and is quite easy to read.

Overall, for home use and serious data collection and blood pressure monitoring, I like this device

I saw these here and ordered two pair to get the free shipping deal.  I should get a deal where I get a cut of the customers I send them because EVERY day I have my customers (several each day) ask me what's going on with my glasses and where did I get them.

I used to go through several pair of reading glasses a month.  Now I have had these two pair for ...gosh, It's got to be close to a year now!  They don't scratch, break, get lost, they're always right there.  I don't know how I did with out them for so long.

Get a couple of pairs you'll love them.  Oh, one thing when the ladies try them on thier hair doesn't always set right with the wrap around thingy.  But I don't know that this can't be overcome....so...something to consider

I have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years----it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist.  It works for me, but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing, brushing, and generally good tooth care.

Great enginering, design and craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a travel size "Waterpick" after 18 months, because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else. It doesn't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part, on an equipment designed to outlast it three times

This simple scale is light, easy to carry and store.

I tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale. It read the same weight, but actually with less flucuation when I shifted on it. I was careful to keep it on a flat surface... I had good luck on old hardwood floors, less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom.

It was very consistent on a level surface... I tested it several times in a row with the same reading, and various times throughout the day... nothing read unusually.

I really like the form factor of this scale. It's so small... Not small spacewise, but just thin, light, with a nice solid place to plant your feet

I rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars because I have not used it enough to know if it does everything it claims....however I have been amazed at how this little contraption does wonders on my back.

When I first got this lumbar extender I set up up in about 2 seconds and then stretched backwards to lay on it. OMG, as I laid down it was like I couldn't even breath for a brief second. To actually feel my back being forced into shape nearly took my breath away as all the muscles were pushed around. I had to relax and it was amazing how sore the muscles in my back were from leaning over my computer at work.

Having used it for about a month now, my back has started to feel much better and I am sleeping better too

For two years I suffered with four herniated discs.   Physical therapy, a spinal injection , chiropractic adjustments, and many sessions on a spinal decompression machine provided short term relief.  I started using the McKenzie Method extension exercises, and this offered the most relief.  Fortunately, I finally discovered the Lumbar Extender in an internet ad.  I noticed that it placed the spine in a similar position as the McKenzie exercises.  So, I decided to order the Lumbar Extender to determine if it would provide better relief than all the other methods I was using.

The first two weeks that I used the Lumbar Extender, I had some minor discomfort.  Now after five weeks using the Lumbar Extender, I can honestly say that my back has not felt better in two years.  This device does all that it says it will do.  I actually enjoy lying on it for two seven-minute sessions each day-one session in the morning and one session at night.

When I first used the device, I heard snapping noises in my lower back, probably the spinal facets being repositioned, and then I would experience immediate relief.  Now I feel as if I have better posture and better curvature to my lumbar region.  The cost of the Lumbar Extender is low compared to a visit to a doctor, and it is worth trying.  I highly recommend it

THE BAD NEWS FIRST: DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK WELL WITHOUT ADDING EXTRA DETERGENT

It seems like this is NOT 3x concentration, and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula. Otherwise, the two products, 'concentrated' and 'standard srength' are the same.

MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - THIS IS CONCENTRATED & COMES OUT LIKE HEINZ KETCHUP:

It does seem to be concentrated, and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle, kind of reminded us of Heinz ketchup.

4-STAR or 5-STAR PRODUCT?

The standard strength product is clearly a 5-STAR product, however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim, it rates 4-STARs with our family.


TRYING TO LEARN OBJECTIVE INFO ON LAUNDRY DETERGENT IS WELL . . . .

THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE OF THIS PRODUCT IN STANDARD STRENGTH or 3X WITH EXTRA DETERGENT ADDED:

I am allergic to most laundry detergents, but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years. It is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available. In addition to being very easy on clothes and skin, it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak. This is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens. It is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this, you may have to pre-soak stains and you won't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it. While "Tide" and "Cheer" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas,["Tide Free" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience. That's why I like this "All Liquid Detergent - Free Clear, Laundry Detergent".

OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS TOUGH TO FIND!

I actually did conduct a hard target search for true, objective information on laundry detergents. There is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which, while important, is not what I was trying to find. "Consumer Reports" does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail.

ABOUT "ALL'S WEBSITE"

If you are looking for this product's website it is under "Unilever" and you will have to specify "USA" under products, as the word "ALL" will show up in almost every search result. You will find "WISK" and "BREYER'S ICE CREAM" and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at Procter and Gamble's site.

It is not one of the stain removers , which instantly gets rid of the stain.
So when you spill over something over your t-shirt, you got to spill this TIDE STAIN REMOVER on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth wouldnt be clogged with STAIN but its not an immedieate relief solution

I was 5 minutes early getting out of the house to go to work one morning so I decided I could stop by a coffee shop and get a mocha. On my way back to my car the mocha "splooshed" out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all over my sweater...naturally, that day it was a white silk knit sweater. So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains, and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change.

The cafe was next to a supermarket so I decided to go buy a Tide to Go pen and give it a try. I applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the stain lightened noticeably. I was a bit worried because after treatment there were still light tan stains visible, but after blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while wearing for about half an hour, there was no hint that any mocha had ever touched my sweater.

The cleansing agent also gets points for not damaging my silk sweater, despite the fact I was rubbing the product in fairly vigorously (out of desperation...I was going to be late for work!)

I'm not sure how it would work on other stains but I will keep one in my purse from now on. On the packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best on, and which it will be less effective on. From other reviews this will not work so well on some common food stains, so that's why I'm giving 4 stars and not 5.

Another minor concern is the warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact with direct sunlight. It doesn't say what will happen if you allow saturated fabric to see sunlight. Perhaps there is the potential for color/fabric damage

I can say before I started to use this product I was always afraid of wearing white clothings but Tide to Go has totally changed everything.  Initially I thought this was just a gimmick but I thought it was worth a try,...soo...I bought it with me during our two-week trip with my parents in August..and it came handy...My dad bought a brand new white jacket and had it put on immediately and then decided to drink a cup of coffee..unfortunately, he spilled the coffee on the white jacket when he tried to open the lid to put sugar in it...my mother immediately wiped the coffee off with napkins..the coffee stain, however, was still there...Then..I remember I had put a Tide-to-Go in my purse...I immediately used it on all coffee stains on the white jacket...and to my surpise, all the brown spots resulted from the coffee spill were GONE...amazing..I have used this on different kind of food stains.  I've used it on Coffee stain, spaghetti sauce stain, juice stain and they all worked.  My mother, my mother-in-law, and my sister-in law they were all so amazed at the result that they all asked me for one to carry with them.  Nowadays I don't leave home without one in my purse..I used to be afraid of wearing white clothings, I am no longer afraid of wearing whites because of Tide-to-Go..this is definitely a useful product to carry with you everywhere you go..oh..as far as the smell goes..The smell is bearable to me...and in order to use it you have to push it down to get the actual fluid to flow out through the tip of the Tide-to-Go marker.

The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root. What an advantage! Hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving.

I don't think it hurts much, though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others. The trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily.

I am very happy with this product

I boutght this razor for my husband.  He likes it, but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers, which he seems to miss a lot.  I think that if he shaved more carefully, he would get these whiskers before they get too long!  I think that for the price (lower end of price range), it does a pretty good job.  Next time, I'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better.

This is a great iron for a starter, but will not do it like a stylist. I have had it for at least 2 years so it will last also. The price is a little bit to high I only paid $ 19.99 for it at Walmart.I know everyone has gotten used to shopping online because it is eay and always open, but I have to tell you that most of the things I have found on amazon are priced way to high. They used to be a great spot to get good stuff cheap but that is no longer true. I think it just kind of creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on. Please folks go back out in to the world and start looking you will see that I am not wrong

I have not try Proactive. The thought of buying something from an infomercial just doesn't sit well with me.  I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now (I'm 35). I spent thousands of dollars on expense department store's brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and Prescriptives. I've also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and chemical peels.  I tried perscription cream, oitments, pads, you name it (even thought of laser).  I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that's when I'd run out and try new products).

Three days ago I bought the Zeno.  I'm going to return it.  It did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me.  I also bought AcneFree and today I went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag.  Three days now, I've noticed my skin cleared up! I'm amazed.  I'm not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared.  I'll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve.  So far AcneFree works for me

Great product, the girls had a blast with it.  Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair.  Great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled!  Although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair.  Not all the time though.  Still a fabulous product.  Would highly recommend it.  My niece wishes it came with more gems

These items are neat little towelettes that come in their own attractive and useful plastic container. They are very handy, and work wonders for insuring cleanliness. Personally, I sure wish I had had these when my first two children were small.

On the down side, flushing these things *can* result in plumbing problems, as I experienced. Apparently, if your sewer line is relatively new and clear, they should give you no problems. But, if your system has any place in it where things can collect, you will face problems. According to my plumber, toilet paper begins to break down quite quickly, but these towelettes can take over a month to do so. (My house was built in 1916!)

So, overall, I do like this product, and I recommend it. I just recommend that if you live in an older house, that you do not flush them

My hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing/smoothing products -- they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth. My hair is very fine, but also thick (which is very annoying). This finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down. It seems very expensive for such a small bottle, but a little goes a long way (I've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it's still not finished). Definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all. The scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming.

i tried all the possible creams on the market, cheap and expensive, for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately. i cannot live without it, this is a keeper. it stings a little bit, not all the time but it does. it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i've had a really tiring week and i'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day, just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them. i guarantee that in three days you'll not recognize yourself(in a good way). very important: it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream( i use pure chamomile cream)and leave it over night. well, follow my recipe and you'll shine fast, you'll see

These are by far the BEST newborn size diapers especially for small babies, but if you order them through Amazon, your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive!  I waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1, which Actually arrived in a few days!

Update: I have ordered Pampers again through Amazon (different size) and they shipped right away

I lost six pounds in eleven days.  I started out taking one-half pill in the morning and one-half in the afternoon.  I was wary of any reaction.  I now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon.  That's enough for me.  I have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise.  No side effects whatsoever.  My problem was the munchies at night watching TV -- and that craving is gone.  I highly recommend this product

Read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child's nusery. I absolutely love it. Before this, my son could not sleep well with our "family's" humiifier because it was too noisy. Within an hour of bringing this home, it was set up (very easily) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that week! No filters, No noise, NO PROBLEMS thus far! I did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath, but the humidifier was near a window, and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top. (The problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop) Filling it is a snap and the very fine mist (looked like small stream of fog) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal! The tank seems to last longer than the box states. It is on it's third day on a low/med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top. I love the safety features and I don't have to worry about the tank still on if it's empty since it has an automatic shut off! The light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room. It is a design that will last thoughout his childhood! Thank you Crane!

It seems to be doing the job....my next dental check will tell. It's a little awkward at first getting used to the brush (quite a bit different from the conventional brush); and I think though they tell you to hold the handle with two fingers only (thumb and forefinger) that you do have to tilt the brush a little to get the gumline. And I still do find a little tartar on my teeth. So, you decide

It takes some getting used to, but once you do you will love it.  It leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush, electric or other, that I have ever used.  You feel at first like it is totally strange (it is!).  Doesn't take more than a few times using it to realize that it's a great concept and so much faster than anything else.

I have no buyers remorse.  I Just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person.  You really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle

I bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair.  It works great!  I gotta admit, it's just big enough for my head and I have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the "extra large" size towel (which isn't really all that large.

The nail attachments work really well and strong, the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so, but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone.Compact size, easy to store and quick charge time

I bought this razor over a year ago, and I wouldn't trade it in for any other razor out there. It really does leave your skin super smooth. I love the triple blades on it so I know I can get a close, comfortable shave, even in hard to reach places. Thanks to the pivoting head, it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut. It's also excellent for shaving the underarm area. I find that one stroke is all it takes, and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe. This is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day, or more than three times a week. With this razor, it shaves so close to the hair follicle, you will be shaving in less time, less often. I will never part with my Venus razor. The best part is - it's a bargain for what you get!

Best hair dryer ever. I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the Conair 213X, my hair is shiny and soft. The diffuser is also amazing; I can wear my hair naturally without any frizz.

By far the best dryer out there in this price range. Granted, it's heavy, but it cuts my drying time in half and I don't have to style after drying which is another plus! It has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the Rhinestones?

I purchased this hairdryer after my professional Conair Yellowbird from the late 70's broke.  I definitely wanted another Conair and I wanted to move into the 21st Century!  I did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price.  I wasn't disappointed.  As the other reviewers have stated, this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time!  It's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are "dry brushing" your hair.  It does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim.  Otherwise, it is very solidly built and I hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years.

Oral B has always been top notch for me and this 8900 DLX is just fantastic.

My teeth are so bad the Dentist always called me the plaque king  lol
but after 6 months on this I went to the next cleaning and they saw a huge improvement.

He calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha

I have been putting this thing to the test for about a year now and I love it...I keep it on the spinning setting which really works well.

do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth, you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but its still a top notch product.

thanks Oral B!!

This is a great product. a friend told me about it. i finally decided to get one. i had bleeding gums. in two weeks of regular use, bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great. just be careful when using the water jet side. you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth, or it will spray all over the place :

I have dry, course hair that certainly gets even drier in the Colorado climate. I have used this product on and off for 10 years and just love the way it defines and adds shine to my hair. I can see if you had fine hair that this product would not be a good thing! I always have to remember that it's the anti-humectant that I like, not the humectant. The humectant version does nothing for my hair and I have purchased it on occasion by mistake.
This stuff smells great too! Makes styling a snap

I am very happy with the Emjoi Compact Epilator that I purchased.  It does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully. Until I asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair, I didn't even know something like this exhisted.  I just wish I would have known about this product years ago.

This booster cushion that you fill with water works very well in the spa.  It is comfortable to sit on and saves wear on bathing suits.  You need to put in in the spa while it is heating otherwise it is cold to sit on.  It is a good product.

I've been using Nicads for long, long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer... the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units, GPS, walkie-talkie's, flashlights, etc.    HOWEVER, these newer NiMH are just great. no memory shelf and longer current life.

I bought this for my aged Mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel I'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle.  She *adores* the microfiber towels I got her!  They are light for her weak arms, they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly.  Not to mention that I, a hearty creature in my prime, love these towels too! I shall be buying more of various styles and colors

I love this item. I received it as a gift and now use it every single day. My hair dries so much faster after having been wrapped up in this. That's great b/c now I do not have to blow dry as much, so my hair seems to be getting a lot healthier. Only complaint would be that it does not stay wrapped very well. Not sure if it's the material or the size, but nonetheless, it still works great.

I got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend.  High blood pressure runs in my family so I wanted to get a monitor to keep track.  I was figuring on getting an arm unit, but when I got this wrist unit I wanted to see how it would work.  The whole system is very easy to use and fast.  You need to be sitting and resting to take the reading, but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you.  I didn't think I would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy.  I can say this was a great gift, something I use a lot, and something that will help me stay healthy

I used to have some Remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs.  It wasn't bad, but sometimes it irritated the skin.  my first shaver was my dad's old school norelco shaver so i thought i'd give them a try again.  the first one i got from amazon was $40 (i forgot the model #) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee.  it was just alright.  this one i feel about the same way.  i mean it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to.  the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and run it under water which i've been doing to clean it) make it worthwhile to me though.  the battery life is also good.  if there was a half star system, i'd give this shaver a 4.5/5

I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would recommend it or give it as a gift.

My husband is in love with this razor!  He thought he was a Norelco-only fan, until I bought him this model for Christmas.  I purchased it due to the great reviews it received, both from consumers and independent reviewers, and also b/c it cost less than $40.  It leaves his face so smooth, whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days.  In fact, he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn.  Highly recommended

My wife and I both love this. In our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable "head trip" than the trippers one might find in the mall. The vibrations make it better than the non-vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming.

Another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations.

It's a pretty simple device, sold at a reasonable cost, and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones

Very good; very satisfying.  Interesting blend of flavors--dried fruit, cocoa, chili.  Nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat.  I couldn't eat one every day, but for an occasional meal replacement, it is very good.  Too high calorie to be a snack item, but it's tempting

I have been using Kiss My Face olive oil soap for years, and I won't let any other soap touch my face! I found it when I was searching for a soap that wouldn't make my skin itch all over after a shower. I can tell you that after years and years, my sensitive skin has never once itched after I used KMF!

The soap is mild, with a neutral scent, which is a big plus. It cleans great, but doesn't leave my skin dried out. The 8 ounce bars are a bit large, but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that's easier for us smaller-hands people

As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.  The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy.  Just 2 noticable disappointments:

1.  The external power supply is a rather combersome change from former Norelco products.

2.  The exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome "feature" of an otherwise good product at a premium price

Very light electric razor.  Cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes.  So a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week.  When running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade.  Does a great job very quickly and smoothly.  You don't need anything more

I've owned several Norelco Shavers in the past but the 7180XL is definitely the best.  This shaver is extremely light weight, quiet and gives an extremely close/smooth shave. I find that I get 5 days of shaves on one full charge and a full charge takes about 50 minutes to complete. The shaver is also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods.
The only complaint I have about the shaver is that no traveling case/pouch holder comes with it to hold the cord,shaver and cleaning brush. Just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously owned shaver(s). Only time will tell on how this model will hold up. My 4 previous Norelcos have averaged around 5-6 years each

I bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for Christmas.  It was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using.  He has been enjoying the features offered by this device.  He especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use.  It gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves.  He has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints.  It was a great price for a quality product

I purchased this for my husband as a gift without ever having smelled it.  I based my purchase on other reviews, and the fact that I have the Burberry classic for women and love it.  I crossed my fingers and hoped that the reviews were right.  Well, they were!  When this came in I could not resist; I had to open the box.  I pulled the outer wrapping back, carefully pulled the box out (I was able to replace all this without hubby knowing), sprayed some into the air, and "ahhhh", wonderful!  I loved it!

It smells wonderful on my husband, too.  It's kind of woodsy, but not overpowering at all.  It's a classic, warm fragrance, and it lasts a long time. I will definitely buy this again

I use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening. IT has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn.
I am very picky about my fragrances and I only use two regularly -- Eau d'Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use Burberry sometimes on occassion and I love it. Thats it

This toilet paper will never feel like the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis, but it is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find in many public toilets. I am willing to compromise a tiny bit of plush, and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers. I do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a product that makes it "rapid-dissolve", and will in time, try an environmentaly friendly brand. A great option for family with kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage, and ignore the presence of a plunger

If you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper, then this is the brand and variant you should switch to.

If I were to objectively judge it by what it promises (rapidly dissolves...), I'd have to give it five stars. It practically melts as soon as it touches water. Don't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink; you'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue.

I'm giving it only four stars, because it's not my favorite toilet paper (that would be Charmin Ultra), but the necessary choice.

I use this product all the time.  It was becoming hard to find in department stores, but I found it available and cheaper online.  I'm very happy.

I love this product and the lasting results. It is so gentle on my hair. I bought two, one being a Christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad perm, and she agreed, makes the set last while not futher damaging your hair.
If you are sleeping in curlers, sleep no more. This product is for you

I really do love this item. I've been using it without fail since the day it arrived. I haven't had any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone. I hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor.

The only problem I have found is that I can't grip things and have the monitor continue working. So when I am lifting weights I have to leave that finger extended, when I'm using the eliptical trainer I have to leave that finger extended. Now that I'm used it, it isn't a big deal.

It is accurate. So far it has agreed with all other monitors that I've checked it against. So with the one minor exception I highly recommend it

i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body. after drinking monster all day, my body felt like a mess(from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body).  There are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals, its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls.

Having tried most all Energy drinks, I can honestly say this one is different. Guru picks me up gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been clipped. One at noon and I'm good to go for the rest of the day. Plus, I don't go home and kick the dog!
The taste is not Sugary and at about $1.40 a can (Free Shipping) the price speaks for itself

I was reluctant to buy this after reading that it wasn't so great on fine hair, but my son's hair was really getting shaggy and I was *NOT* going to wrestle with him at the barber shop again. So I bought this and was so happy when it worked perfectly on his hair. I used the 1 inch guide for his whole head and he looks great! The vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing, because I cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house. He didn't have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape, which he hates.

Having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer--what it sounds like, and feel like-- in his own time and environment. He cut his stuffed bear's hair first, then daddy's, then his own by himself and then let me cut his. What a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming.

At $25, it has already paid for itself. I'm so glad I bought it. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it is pretty loud and  had a really crappy users manual.

Bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and I used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there, no hair on him or pillows or sheets.  This is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair, I also used it on the tougher part of his beard.  Wonderful item

This unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part. The handheld part is mostly made of plastic. So, it's pleasantly light to hold, much lighter than my Wahl homecare thing.

The supplied guard things (that you swap to change length, etc.; IIRC they range from 1/8" to 1") have a curve on the bottom so it's easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them. This also makes things more pleasant.

Don't believe the no-mess story, though. It really does catch most of the hair, so it's certainly worthwhile, and it's easy to empty the hair trap, but I still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards. It doesn't catch it all

I bought this product because I had one from years ago that I use when I go to the gym but lost.  It's great at drying me off while i'm working out and yet the towel isn't wet.  I am conflicted though.  I bought this one when I lost the one I already had.  It's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original, but I still like it for what it does.  I also like the little bag that it comes in, which I didn't have with the original one

After looking into several reviews on blow dryers, I learned about the Revlon Tourmaline.  All of the reviews were so positive.  I've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are.  The placement couldn't be better on the controls. The price was right as well!  Blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive.  A very good value

Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer.  No frizz, quick drying results.  The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job.  The motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use.  Don't waste your money on the expensive ones

Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break.

Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face.
The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face

I bought this item last month from Amazon.com for $149. I thought it is using some kind of hand-like massage motors, and not those vibration motors. When the item arrived and I setup, I found out they are using the vibration motors! A little disappointed I am. But I use it, it is not bad if you don't mind the vibration motors. The heat feature is great. However, the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position isn't holding well. The leather-like material really feels like a lether. The vibration really vibrates the whole floor, so I suggest to put on carpetted areas only. I personally like the hand-like massage chair better. But this $149 chair is worth the price. Others would sell for over $300

This model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago.  I bought another off of Amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it, and I figured I could use a second one to keep in my travel bag.  I'd have to say I'm pretty pleased with the trimmer.  I like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when I want to change the trimming depth.  I use it a few times a week, and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge.  The little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest....It's catches probably 70% of what I trim.  You'll want to be sure you're standing over a sink or towel when using it.  Well worth the $30 I spent for this grooming tool

I've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming!
Also the unit is easy to clean out after use.  The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris

This was the first brand of nursing pads I tried.  My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy.  Yet after trying several brands of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh.  They are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after I had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable. The best deal I have found has been amazon's price for 3 boxes.

It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer. It does its job pretty nicely. The dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world. A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight. The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage. It is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment

These little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums.  Flossing with traditional floss hurt because I always cut myself and deeply.  It probably saved me from serious gum disease, and that I understand is expensive to treat, so I'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy

I'm more than satisfied with this scale.  I was concerned that I would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy (see reviews of other digital scales in this price range,) but I've tested it several times over several days, and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day.  My first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings, sadly.

The neutral color (grey) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor, and the LCD screen is easy to read, with 1.5 inch high numbers.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when I step on it, even though I'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load.  That problem is in my head more than in the scale: I don't think it's going to break, but it sounds like I've got two people standing on it at once--I'm not THAT fat, am I?

An added feature is that when I'm craving, I go into the bathroom and look at it, and know that it isn't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning.  So the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge.  The scale has intimidated me into not eating it.

Accurate, easy to read, easy on the eyes, and intimidating--I think it's a good deal

I recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past Christmas.  I am a physical therapist, and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction.  I have tried out many cushions over the years, and from my experience, this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent.  The composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained, so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use, and the burgundy cover is removable and washable.  It is also an excellent size for the average-sized person (my dad is approximately 5'9", ~170 lbs.).  It provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back.  I highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products.  Most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives, like a massager, ribbing on the contours of the cushion, etc.  I've found that simply maintaining good posture (not only in sitting, but all activity) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life.  Again, I highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain; however, I must caution that commercial products are NOT a cure-all to one's problems.  It's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms, but other steps are necessary in terms of FIXING the problem.  I highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist, as it is more than likely necessary that one would need (at least) proper education and intevention to help one to get better.

I bought this after using the inexpensive Wahls for years.  I love it for several reasons:
1) It cuts without pulling on your whiskers
2) It is very precise
3) It picks up 90% or more of your whiskers
4) Not only do you not have the hair in the sink, but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard, if there is any to speak of
5) Unlike others, I did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache.  It worked just fin

I had bought a Tingler elsewhere for $20, plus shipping, so when I saw this one advertised for $9, I was a bit hesitant that it wasn't the real Tingler, but a cheap knock-off (especially since they show no picture). BUT, I decided to risk it and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is not only the real Tingler, it is also shipped in a pretty velvet pouch for wonderful gift-giving. Amazon, of course, also offers free shipping for $25 or more, so I bought 3 and got them all shipped free! Great deal! And, by the way, it IS incredible! It really did send little shivers down my spine the first few times I used it. While you sort of get used to the feeling after a while and the little shivers may disappear, it still feels fabulous on your head

Like the razor - I have problems with ingrown hairs on my neck and this shaver has helped to alleviate the problem - the Nivea lotion is very soothing.  I have had to live with the fact that the shave on my neck is not the closest in the world but c'eat la vie.  I have taken to running a couple of passses dry to get a fairly close shave and then starting to apply the lotion as I continue.  If you start with the lotion you won't get a close shave.  I do wonder if one couldn't simply buy a shaver ad apply some lotion at the end for the same affect

I never thought the world would get here.  I am actually spending time to type up a review, online, for shaving lotion.
Well, here you go:  for every man out there who is interested and who has ever used an electric shaver, if you haven't tried the Norelco Cool Skin electric shaver with this lotion, you have to.  Whoever has sensitive skin, you need to switch to this, because it does a great job.  That's all I have to say and I won't waste anymore time

... I purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely.

The microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady, but soft and textured.

Using it was easy, I just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone. (some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but wasn't)

The packaging is a little subpar though. It comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out. However doing so leaves adhesive residue, which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off, making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed up I'd say. This is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination, so I used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off.

I've yet to machine wash it, but so far it works well. It's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all

After total knee replacement, this wedge sure helped to keep my knee in one place and elevated, while preventing me from moving too much while I slept or was resting.

Highly recommended

This is the second Aquis Microfiber Body towel I have purchased.  The waffle weave makes a huge difference.  I had a plain microfiber towel and it just didn't feel like a towel.  The Aquis towel has a real towel feel, dries me off  great and then dries out quickly.  I keep it in my gym locker and it's dry the next time I need it.  In the summer, I use it after swimming in the morning and it's dry by the time I teach swimming in the afternoon.  And it doesn't take up much room in my locker or gym bag.  It would be great where I used to spend my summers in Michigan where it was tough to dry out the beach towels.

Having had perfectly clear skin through my teens, 20s, and most of my 30s, I now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. My skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products. I bought this product out of desperation, not believing it would work. After reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks, I have found that it works well, with some modifications. My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.) in a fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated as directed with Zeno, OR it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface (after a week or so), when treated very aggressively with Zeno. My advice: Don't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised. Do know that with diligence and patience, it will work. Be very aggressive. Do double-cycles (allow the Zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps, then press the button for a second cycle) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way. You may get very slight burning of your skin (causing a whitish film or slight peeling) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly, but believe me, it's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne. I am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition, and seeing the results I have hoped for after 2 weeks

My Mom came home from rehab and needed an easy way to reach her remote, pills, magazines, eat breakfast... and still get the  table out of the way so she could reach her walker.  This type of tray was very useful in rehab.  However she didn't want something the looked like the hospital.  The white top with a space for a drink and pens and pencils that don't roll away when you move the tray was perfect.  She liked the white top (vs. the wood grain in rehab) since she could tell when it was really clean.  She was also pleased with the foot rest as part of the base.  This was perfect.  The reason I rated this at 4 stars and not 5 stars was that the bed kit came with one incorrect size nut so I had to go to the hardware store.

The Oral B EB417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places, reaching back teeth, removing plaque, has a nice gum massage action, and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed. The two heads work twice as good as one, but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head.

Using it by gently guiding it over your teeth, and letting it do all the work, it will last a long time too. It was nearly three months before I had to replace mine. Most Oral B brushes are interchangeable with all Oral B units. This one though, according to the buying info here, may not be used with the Cross Action brush. It will also indicate when it's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles.(the box shows as good picture of new and used). Just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too!

It's a 5 star product, but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out, the better buy would be to purchase the three pack. It's almost like getting one free. My pack also came with different color rings, that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart. It's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well.

Keep Smiling....Laurie

I bought the Remington MB-300 Mustache and Beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky. He has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed. The Remington has several adjustments for length,that pleases him the most,it trims whatever he aims it at,and does it well. It is light weight and maneuvers easily.

The day I ordered this pair at Amazon, I saw the same Homedics slippers at Sears for $21.99 on sale and I was immediately assured that price wise, this is a great buy. I got the slippers within 3 days. The material is very soft and "towely", and pretty in pink- it feels really good to just walk in them. Though they have a battery compartment underneath the sole, they are not too heavy to walk in either. Each slipper uses 2 AA batteries. The massage is actually more effective while sitting. And my mum and my sister keep eyeing my slippers. I ordered another one for my future mum-in-law as well! I'm sure she'll love it. Also, I wear a shoe size 8, sometimes 8.5, but the Homedics Small Size for the massaging slippers fit just fine, actually a little better coz a good fit gives a better feeling of the vibrations. If you're thinking of buying this, go for it

When I first tried this Marshmallow Vanishing Crème in a sampler kit, I purchased five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this product. Can I say it is addictive?

Yes, I guess it does have a banana cream pie scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whip cream. To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream.

Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it "vanishing" crème. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance.

Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.

"Marsh Mallow" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.

I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal.

If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.

I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel. They add a level of protection to your skin care routine and the clay mask I recently tried cleaned my pores like a dream.

I purchased the Caruso for my wife after returning a Conair Infinity. The Conair Infinity did not measure up to her expectations. She is happy with the Caruso and feels that it does an good job setting curl. I will offer a few observations of my own. I would think that companies that produce these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader spectum of customer. For instance, women have different lengths of hair. This device provides 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large, 6 jumbo. That might be fine for women with shoulder length hair, but not for everyone.
There's not enough of one size to get the job done. There's not enough of two sizes to get the job done. If your hair has just been cut, it's to short to use the larger sizes, unless you have long hair to start with. My wife's hair is not quite shoulder length, she's got a problem. So, I figured, no big deal, just order a dozen of the right size. One dozen additional rollers cost $35. I only paid $29 for the unit with 30 rollers.
That's not what I call customer friendly.

Now I finally have the look and feel of a celebrity.  The best product on earth period!  I've tried all ingrown hair product's since 1985 beleive me Ive' spent thousand of dollars, nothing comes close to it "forget about it" Saliylic Acid is history in my book. Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure.  I bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006.  Since the new year 2007 started I've already bought 2 bottle's and I'm spreading the word.  Don't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away.
Thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face.

This humidifier is easy to refil and not a  big eye-sore even in small rooms.  Also, stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers.  Would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours.  Which I guess it's good that it's easy to refil.  The price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price.  Perhaps you pay for the convient size.
Overall, I really do like this humidifer and is the only one I like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size.

As soon as I got this item, I tried it out right away.  I will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that's a minor point.  The real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do -- take down mosquitos and flys.  Sure enough, I killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes.  I also took down a housefly without any sweat.  This is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where I'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects.  No more an issue

Having previously owned battery powered travel razors, I was always disappointed with their power and battery life. After all, what's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced? The Braun 370-BK was a pleasant surprise, however; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing. I also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost. A great piece of tech at a good price

Being sick and tired of shaving constantly and buying expensive blades, I did some research and decided to try an epilator.  I figured I'd give this model a try. I have not been disappointed!  Yes, it hurt the first time I used it--I hadn't shaved in almost a week and I had a lot of thick dark hair.  But, it was pulling it right out.  The more you use it, the less it hurts. I haven't had ugly, rough stubble since. I also like that Panasonic has included a shaver head--this works great to trim up too-long hairs before epilation or for the more sensitive areas that are just too painful to epilate.  The heads are easily interchangable and a snap to clean.  This is a great all-around epilator/shaver.

Definitely the best heating pad I've ever experienced. I'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again. This is by far the best and well worth the money. I love that it can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other heating pads I've ever seen (that only have "high medium and low" settings, and usually the high and medium settings cause burns, or don't get hot enough, or go from barely any heat to burning!) This heating pad's lcd shows the actual temperature it's at, which is great. And yes it feels very moist, but not like you're getting dampness on your clothing. My only complaint is that it shuts off after 60 minutes. I could easily have this on all day :

As a dentist of over 20+ years experience, I have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one's teeth.  The unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline.  The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.

I have heard all the excuses for not flossing: The floss is too hard to handle, my fingers turn blue, my fingers are too fat, I'm too clumsy, the floss hurts my gums, etc, etc.  This disposable flosser is great for kids, who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser, such as the "Flossaide Dental Floss Holder", which I recommend for adults (see my review).

I have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and I strongly recommend it to you as well.  One still has to develop the habit of flossing daily, and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing, making it a breeze.  Get it and save your teeth!

I bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair.  It works great!  I gotta admit, it's just big enough for my head and I have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the "extra large" size towel (which isn't really all that large.

This is a great fiber supplement!!  When you chew it, it starts out kind of crunchy but quickly turns chewy kind of like a chewy sweet-tart.  I usually keep a glass of water by even thou it says you don't need water. They have a good flavor and yes I do use it as a substitute for candy every once in a while. Just remember too much of a good thing will give you gas :-) so don't be in a small elevator.

Great compact design. Takes up very little room in your suitcase. Rollers heat up & are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims. Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many). The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers. But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set & use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!

This is the one I buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office. It is like the one I bought 5 years ago with my first baby, the one that is still humming along.

I have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child, a boy who persists in having 'tiny' ear canals even though he is three now. It has worked well for every other kid I know though.

About the variation in temperature taking. My advice is to practice taking your and your children's temperature while you and they are healthy. For one thing, not everyone has the `standard' 98.6 degree normal temperature; and for another thing it isn't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal. It takes practice.

A good home purchase. (For really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success.

I got this product when the price dropped down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops. It is  especially a great buy during winter

Such a thoughtful gift.  A real treat for those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter.  The warm lotion is truly a treat to dry, itchy winter skin.  Anyone would love this!

Dr. Scholl's Foot Cream was excellent. It's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell. My feet felt softer in the morning after using it at night and I noticed a difference immediately in my dry, cracked heels. I also ended up using it on my hands and elbows before I went to bed. Especially my hands were really soft in the morning. I've tried other foot creams and not been really impressed. But I think the difference is that Dr. Scholl's has no alcohol in it, and it's really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your skin

For me a good  tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer. I had the same one, this brand, for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment. I immediately ordered my new tweezer. If not dropped I suspect this would last a lifetime

I bought this scale for my wife (ya, I'm that sort of guy)! She's definitely not heavy, but 'concerned' and a follower of Weight Watchers. I was shocked to read various scale reviews prior to purchasing this one and find so many that did not weigh accurately! Well, this one was highly rated by most reviewers for accuracy & they are right. This scale is very accurate in determing a person's mass (sorry, I was a Physics major too) and confirmed at her Weight Watchers' weighings. As for it's accurate determination of "body fat" and "water", I can't say, but feel these are a bit gimicry anyway.

As for my wife, she loves the scale & me. Although, her love for me covers over many poorly chosen gifts, so I'm not absolutely sure about her love for the scale. However, I do know she uses it ever day and enjoys telling me of her victories

My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light.

I received the Tranquility Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks, too.

I've given this 5 stars because there's no option for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades.

Even with these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it, too

If you have trouble sleeping...THIS mask is for you!!  For anyone struggling to get even a few minutes worth of sleep...  You will not be disappointed!!  Fabulous!  Whether for a nap or for getting through the night - this mask will definitely help!  I have given several as gifts and everyone is in agreement with me!  The only negative is - the company changed from an endless sound model to 30 minutes of sound...therefore - I wake up and have to re-hit the sound selection...but, I'm still getting more sleep than I have in years and years!

I looked a many other back support pads.
Some were too big, and others were just complicated.
The Obus Forme Side to Side is perfect.
It is very light weight and small, therefore, very portable.
I use it in the car and take it with me to the office.
The strap on the back fits well around any chair back,
although, I have found I don't need to use it because it stays put

The stuff can seem somewhat pricy (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror. I've had great pumps before, but this was insane! It didn't even look like me at all; it felt great. I've been using it for 2 months now and I don't train a day without it. Highly, highly recommended

3. shape. It stays put in my truck & doesn't roll around.
4. does a great job of what its intended to do, nothiing more.

The best sports bar around. Great taste, organic, contains plenty of Antioxidants, and contains a good amount of protein.

I absolutely love this stuff. I would recommend this to any person that has frizz. It makes my hair feel so silky smoothe. I started using it about 2 months ago and cannot stand to go without it. Just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and don't put it close to the scalp either for the same reason. I tried the Chi Silk Infusion because I thought they would be the same since they are both made by Farouk but the Chi is not nearly as good. I would give this 100 stars I could.

Had I read these reviews before buying this, I probably wouldn't have purchased it.  But I had been looking at the much more expensive Sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended Sonicare after I asked.  I didn't ask if there was a certain MODEL that he recommended, so I assumed I'd have to pay from $40-$150 for a Sonicare.  When I saw this one for $30 at Target, I figured I didn't have much to lose.

I've had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist couldn't get.  It turns off automatically after 2 minutes, so I know that I'm brushing my teeth longer.  One thing that takes getting used to is NOT removing it while it's going...you'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself! :D  Another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush!!

The only negative is that it goes thru 2 AA batteries about once a month, but the directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change and that's about right.  I've started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems.

I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And isn't that what we want in the end?
I don't know anyone who buys one of these things for its "ergonomic design features." It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse it clean with running water and you're done. That's what I'm looking for.

The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running. It seems like it's always needing a charge...but that's how it sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus.
Also, the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated.

Have had several Norelco razors over the years.  This is the closest shave I have ever gotten from any electric razor - and it is also the quietest.  Only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave.  Highly recommend

Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it. Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip. The only con I see is the 8 hour charge time, which has been the norm for Norelcos in this class for a long time. If you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price, this is a great choice

Upgraded to this razor after my old Remington died, and I've been very happy with it.  It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the "Lift & cut."

This would be an excellent razor if it wasn't for two features (or lack thereof) that make it a pain to use.

1.  The internal battery is NiCd.  This type of battery has "memory" to it, which means for optimal performance, the battery should be fully drained before you recharge it.  Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless.
2.  There isn't a low battery indicator.

By itself, either of these features wouldn't pose a problem.  Combined, you're left wondering when you'll have to charge the shaver, or when you're off on that business trip, if you'll need to bring the charger.

In the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that's not 15 years old.

Product arrived as expected.  I've had the tooth brush for about a year now and I love it.  One complain I have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach.  I have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even better.

The first epilator that I used was The Epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's.  I did not use this for long....
A tool of complete TORTURE!

I finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from "VEET" which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that I was completely hooked on using an epilator. Good-bye razors and wax!

I figured that if a single roller did a good job that the Conair which had two rollers would do even better. The Conair does a good job and I'm keeping it as my spare,  but the epilator from Veet actually does a better job.

I no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and I even do my bikini area and underarms.

I love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing.
Once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over.

UPDATE:  I've had more time to use the Conair Epilator and now I've actually been using it more than my "Veet".

Just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it.

As a matter of fact I am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends

I pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b/c washable ones were sufficient.  With my second child, I did both and I found these to be the best b/c washable ones are not enough.  They are large so won't shift when you roll in bed.  They are very absorbent though I have woken up a couple times trenched.  They are very thin and discreet.  Other pads are not as big so not enough overage.  I never bother with the adhesives b/c they don't work.  They are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk.  I just wished they were softer and less paper like

I found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what I want it to and I only paid $14.99 for it. It doesn't cause my hair to frizz up and it's easy to style when I take the rollers out. As far as it taking too long to heat up, I don't really let that affect my review because I plug it in and while it is heating up I do my makeup or something else. (I'm a multi-tasker anyway)  I also don't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair.  Overall I like it.

Over the years, I have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked using any of them.  I recently bought a new set which I had to return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my hair....scream! I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest  way to curl my hair.  The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  I've found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  I'm hard to please, so my recommendation says alot.  Thanks Remmington (I still don't like your other regular rollers! Ha)

I have read reveiws before i bought it that said the trimmer "pinches" or cut people, but i haven't found that to be the case. I wouldn't use it in ultra sensitive places (but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially dangerous near sensitive areas) but it does the trick quite well.  I have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a good price.  It also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver (which wasn't advertised when i bought it) but worked well on my legs; not as great as some more expensive  electric leg shavers but is great when you don't have much time.  All in all i suggest buying it.

I purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers. We are all on our feet all day long. After one other coworker told us about the one he had, we all had to have one to help our tired feet. Everyone of us is very happy with this product. It is a great value for the price. There are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We did have a problem with one, but Amazon quickly exchanged it for us. I think it was defective from the factory. Great product and even better service from Amazon

This hair dryer is truly a professional, salon type dryer. Many dryers are advertised as such, but this one lives up to that reputation. Very sleek, beautiful coloring and easy to handle with Turbo feature. This was a surprise(turbo) which I'm enjoying, coupled with the smooth and strong drying. The sound is even pleasant, not too loud, and it works quickly.(especially since I have very thick hair)
I would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price.

We keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed.  It takes a 30 minute cycle, and you just put things in and walk away.  It hasn't damaged anything vs. sanitizing in the washing machine - and I don't have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers.  We've even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes, etc. to periodically clean them.  I think it's great

The shaver was very good.  It gives a very close shave.  Not only do I shave my face but I also shave my head.  It feels like I use a normal shaver after I am done.  My nly advice is to empty the hair out between every shave.  It seems to give a better shave this wa

Works great but I wish I could find it in stores.  The one RiteAid that does carry it, doesn't always have it in stock.  I also can not always find it in just any Rite Aid.  Some don't carry it at all...annoying!

My daughter is the canker sore sufferer.  I did some research before I discovered Rembrandt, and found that the ingredient, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, found in almost all toothepastes is the culprate.  Rembrandt for Canker Sores does not contain this key ingredient.  Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is what makes our toothepaste foam.  My daughter hardly ever has anymore canker sore breakouts.  If she does, it seems to be from getting a cold.  Try and find a toothpaste without SLS...they aren't out there.  It would be nice to have some competition to bring the price down and be more readily available.  But all in all, I'm glad someone has made this product available, even if it's pricey and hard to find.

These wipes are strong, have just the right amount of moisture, and don't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave. My son had diaper rashes as a newborn; when we were at home, we could wash/rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering, but when we were out, and had to use wipes, his rash would flare up. After switching to these wipes and 7th Gen diapers, the rash went away. Later on, I tried Pampers again, and the rash came back. Using Seventh Gen really has kept his skin rash free. My older son also has a lot of itching when we use Pampers; much less with these wipes & diapers

I don't know if it makes your hair shiny or not (I never noticed increased shine) however, I do think it does it does a nice job.  It worked better when my hair was around shoulder length, but it puts a nice curl in your hair and as long as it's not too humid out, it stays in.  Now that my hair is down to my waist, it doesn't hold curl anymore.  Just a little on the ends and if it's even a little humid, forget it.  The main thing that bothers me about this set is the clips that hold the rollers in.  I don't know what they were thinking, but they really suck.  They pull on your hair a little while they're holding the roller in and make you look an awful lot like madusa.  Anyone who happens to see you will most certainly have a few jokes and laughs

Well, the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great [compared to other battery operated shavers]. I agree.

My point is that one can buy Lithium batteries for about a dollar each. Google for LED flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap Lithium batteries. Some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys

Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken.

Its a very nice little fountain. The lighting on the ceiling is really cool and the water noises are adjustable depending on how you arrange the rocks. It doesn't have near enough rocks, so I'm going to go and get some, but I think once I fill it up a little more it'll look a lot better too. I'm satisfied, I actually bought another one :

I purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself. The person for whom I purchased them is very happy with them and so am I. I was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because I have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour. It is too soon to tell but I hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands.

I loved it then and have used it on several other things since..great on chapped hands, lips etc.  But I don't know what I would have done without this wonder creme.  And it's an essential baby gift that I tend to give at showers!

This is a great heating pad if you like heat. It ranges from Low to HI with 4 settings in between. (that is 6 settings) Especially nice is the loooooong cord.  My old heating pad has like a 6 ft. cord and I always needed an extension cord for it. Good purchase!

I have had this heating pad for over a year and am very pleased with it.  The auto shut off is annoying when I forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but otherwise, very pleased.  Just ordered one for my grandma and she is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it doesn't "rattle" like the old fashioned ones.  Great improvment and larger size

Smells DIVINE! This is a powder-sweet and refreshing scent that won't overwhelm the senses. It's soft and subtle, yet killer if it complements your body chemistry.

This razor is fantastic. The gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad!! The only problem I had with it was the gel parts don't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would. But if you are looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is exactly what you are looking for

I have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries (6 two-packs) and I must say that they work exactly how I projected them to. They hold a charge well enough for my uses in  various electronics and my infant's papasan swing. Regular Duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days. These batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life and I have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss. I am very pleased so far with my purchase. Get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size D become easily available and cheaper

I didn't have any trouble with them being too large. I tested them in a battery-operated light string against a no-name, non-rechargeable brand and they lasted almost exactly the same amount of time.

The Jerdon 7P7506CF (or as I call it, the ol'6CF) is a nice, reflective wall-attachable mirror.  I can't say enough about how reflective this thing is; I'm a bit of an amateur facepainter (although I have zero artistic ability- my Spider-Man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes), so I need a good mirror whenever I self-paint.  I have gone through three similar models before finding the 6CF, and none has been as clear and user-friendly.

In short, if you're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar, I can't recommend this thing enough.  It's the mirror of the 21st century, and beyond

I have a Braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews I just had to try out the Panasonic and I am v impressed.
Dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too, a v close shave in about 2 minutes. I keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness.
I dont use the cleaning station, I just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results I am getting I am well pleased

I work at a nursing home for the elderly and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to go home, and to know that I have this product at my beck and call. WOW!! I am a owner of this product for 6 months now and I all I can say is I love it.. So what is requires special water a gallon lasts me for two months so I don't mind spending $.75 every two months. I use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser from Panasonic and I now I use less make up than ever. I normally wear foundation, pressed powder and loose. Now it is just pressed powder. It allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my pores. I do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the treatment along with a favorite cd and I am on a fifteen minute vacation without leaving home.  I take the towel  off and my pores are ready for the final stage. I turn on the cool mist and apply a moisturizer at the last minute and I am ready to face another day.

I'm usually a very skeptical person and I don't trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time. But these vitamins actually do work. It takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work. So if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results. The only thing I hate about the product is the price. But if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you're in luck. I'm young and I don't have alot of money so I can't buy these vitamins all the time. But if you have a steady cash flow then you're in luck and they will totally help you

Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually bought this shaver to use on my head. I have been shaving my head for the past 2 years and during that time have used a Panasonic ES8066. It was a fine product (able to be used either wet or dry, unlike the Braun), but I had no idea that upgrading to the Braun 8985 would make such a difference. I shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the Panasonic! No longer did I need to keep going over the same spot again and again. The Braun took off the hair in one or two passes, cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation. I can't believe I wasted two years shaving with my old shaver! I know Panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers, and I can't comment on its new Vortex shaver, but I know I won't be returning my new Braun any time soon

Initially the sensation made me giggle.  After a couple uses I got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly.  My teeth feel cleaner, mouth fresher, and I'm hopeful that I will no longer get the "floss" lecture from my dental team.
Now that's something to smile about!

My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.

I was skeptical of this product - especially at the price - however I am so pleased with its effectiveness.  I rely on other reviewers remarks and so I am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price.  I can't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple. When I think of all the money I've spent on products over the years - and I'm in my 40s!  I was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red, angry looking spot.  This product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne.  I only wish the Zeno was around when I was a teenager

These glasses are a great idea.  However, they do not work with long hair.  The back "strap" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair

Good Product - the pressure could be a little stronger with the sponge head.   It has a nice scent, and when the crystals had leaked upon arrival I had excellent customer service from the company to replace it.

This was my heating pad, but my hairless cat took it over. He has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one. The first day I couldn't pry him off.

I love that it's washable. In fact, I'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash. Of course, I keep it pretty low for him. Being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that's not enough.

Pink Sugar is a wonderful scent. I have received many compliments on this fragrance. Its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey. It is however a sweet scent. Everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it. At this price $32.14 for 3.4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that. I say buy it you cannot go wrong

I've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair (and have it stay straight)! I am happy to say that I've finally found something that works! I've had many different straighteners, and this one is by far the best. I have long curly hair, and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes. Much better than the hour I'm used to. Plus, the straightening lasts. My hair stays completely flat all day, instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener. You simply can't get better than this!

I bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser (well, the PINK one was my idea) and this is by far the best product I've ever used. I even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great - and it's usually a nappy, tangled mess after I work out. There really is nothing better than the CHI for straight, silky hair. I've used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it. It's worth the price

My arms used to get so sore because I'd blow-dry my thick, frizzy, curly hair for about 1 1/2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal-mart.

After having a stylist at Mastercuts use this on my hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour, I knew I had to buy this product.

This is a great price considering at most places like Trade Secret, the iron alone can cost about $129 plus tax, plus the Chi products are $15 and up.

It's a great value, and it benefits a great cause, so why not?

So if you have unruly, thick, curly hair- this is the product for you!

Just be careful because it does get really hot- I burned my ear a bit. Other than some common sense, anyone can use it and achieve great results.

I tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it, and I've almost got it down

Over the years at various jobs, I have seen this flashlight several times. It is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse. It may end up looking beat up and yucky, but they always work, no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it. If you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox, work truck, pick-up glove compartment, etc., this is the only one you need.

If you need a good flashlight at home, and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store, this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy. I finally bought one just for my home, and I am only sorry I did not do this years ago (I am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox; I refuse to replace it).

I like this version because it has a strong magnet, and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck. I also like that it has switch guards, so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox.

One nit-picky complaint. It has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector. However, it comes empty and you have to supply your own, so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight.

First, this is a big and cumbersome....  but second, this is the best foot spa.  Got it for the wife and had to try it myself.  I am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and I had to ease into the heat, it stayed hot the entire time.  The jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless (just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you don't have to move an inch :)  ).  The rollers on the bottom are nice too.  It gets loud when on high-jets mode, but nothing to grand.  Fast shipper, would recommend

The dispenser looks good, holds a decent volume of shampoo, conditioner etc. It is simple to refill the bottles, and so far there is no leakage. The mounting was easy, glued onto the tiles with silicone glue (included). If it broke or we decided to replace it, we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles. The top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front, so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head, the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf. The little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads. Overall satisfied, good product for the price

This was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit. I had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up.  They love it!!! Not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap, shampoo,etc., my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well

I own this unit for more than a year. Bought it in the local drug store for $20. First unit was bad, displaying low battary error. I exchanged it same day for another one. I compared readings with traditional thermometers  and found it to be very accurate, fast, and can show in both C and F. The best I've ever had.
The case is bad - lock broke in a week

I was all set to do the typical 10 day antibiotic course for a sinus infection (I even had bought the antibiotics), but decided to try this first. It is very effective in clearing the sinuses, nose, throat and lungs. Couple things:

1. It makes a minor mention of using a solution (if desired) in the tank provided. I used Vicks. It more than doubles the steam output. So even if you don't get a solution, use plain water. Without it, the output is not impressive.

2. If you do get Vicks, get your magnifying glass out and read the dilution instructions. They do not make it clear without reading the fine print that it is a highly concentrated solution. If you add it undiluted, I think you'll go blind...

I highly recommend this unit

This is a great sized foot bath.  I pour hot water in it, sit back and relax.  It doesn't keep the water warm, but if I start off with really hot water it stays warm until I'm ready to get out.  Using the pedicure attachements is hard work though- I just assume use a hand-held brush.  The bubble feature is too loud to use while watching TV.  Still, for the price, I like this foot bath. I've even given it as a gift

I bought this for my boyfriend. I needed something affordable, and this was it. The bubble machine is quiet, and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time.
The only complaint i have are the warnings it has. It just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if I make a mistake.
well other than that, this product is good. I've had it for I think a couple of months now, and nothing awful has happened and it's still working fine. :

This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter

I've had my son in Huggies brand since he was born. I started out with newborns and just went up in size. I loved them and they never sagged (unless they were really full). I loved the trim look to them. When I had to get Pampers brand because the store was out, the pampers brand always looked like he had a full sagging load. Even if I had just put them on and they were dry!
When my son was 1, he decided to take off the "tape" on the daipers and he just would not keep it on. So I switched him to pull ups. He kept those on and has been in pull ups for 3 years. Sometimes they did leak at night, because he went too much, but if I changed him once a night he was fine. Now that he's older, I don't have to change him, because he doesn't go at night.
These are really best out there, and they don't look like they are always sagging like other diapers

I have medium colored hair, and I've used this trimmer many times.  It shaves away the hair just fine for me, you know need to know how to get to all the hair.  If your hair is so coarse that this trimmer doesn't work, you I'd recommend waxing!  Fast, effective, good angling

I have received so many compliments on this fragrance. I can always pick out the scent when someone else is wearing it. Although a fragrance will smell different on each person, I have not known of anyone this one did not work for. I guess the negative reviewer is the first I have heard of. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a fresh fragrance

This is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs.  Also check out Elaine Petrone's MIRACLE BALLS, which you can also use in the car and for other things.  The support is sturdy and has a mesh back, which helps to keep you cool and comfortable.  A GREAT deal for the cost

I really liked this product.  I am a late 30's woman whose skin is basically pretty good.  I have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads, but even before I bought the Neutrogena microdermabrasion I would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is. But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided to try the Neutrogena at home system.

The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply.  The cream had the slightest pleasant smell, and was not sticky at all.  I used well less than a teaspoon, so a little goes a long way.  It was no problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was very easy to clean as well.  The treatment took me less than 10 minutes, fit in easily to my bedtime routine, and after the initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week.

My skin definitely felt softer, smoother and more invigorated.  I could notice a difference after only one treatment.  But the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that I looked younger.  (He didn't know about the microdermabrasion.)  And even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty.  There was a clear and noticeable difference--after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow, and the few large pores I have did appear smaller.

Being lazy, I have not incorporated it into my regular routine like I should, but I do pull it out a few days before special occasions, vacations, or anytime I feel the need for a little brightening up, and will definitely always keep it on hand.

If you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive.  For me, it was a painless process, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow

It's all in your technique (which took me many trials to learn)

If you have had professional microdermabrassion then you will know how much scrubbing and pressure you will need to apply on your face. The crystals are abrasive and if you do not have the proper techniques you will hurt your face. I use the crystals in pure form ONCE a week (without the vibrating mechanism) BEFORE BEDTIME. These are the steps I do that WORK FOR ME. You may have a different system that might WORK FOR YOU.

1.	Thoroughly wash face with cleanser (I use Neutrogena facial liquid soap) and rinse well.
2.	While still damp, I use crystals to thoroughly exfoliate my face avoiding eye area. I go around in QUICK circular motion while applying pressure for 1 minute.
3.	I rinse quickly and use Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser to get all the crystals out since crystals are difficult to get out(it is also soothing).
4.	(Its not over yet) After patting my face dry I follow up by using Neutrogena Pore Refining Mask. It's a cooling gel that you keep on for 5 mins to tighten pores. Rinse off and pat dry.
5.	I do not put anything else on my face before sleeping.

My face comes out really fresh, soft and smooth. The next morning I just use the cream cleanser to wash.

Compared to the first humidifier I got from walmart, this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect. Oh, well I just got it yesterday so it's too early to say perfect, but considering others' reviews, I am pretty confident that I am gonna love it longer than at the first sight.
The only thing is I don't know where to put it. The power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long. I am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest, or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time

I have two penguin humidifiers which I purchased a couple of months ago. For the money I think these are great and simple to use. I did not have any problems with leakage--the key is to make sure that the top is on securely. Also, some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base--just carry a washcloth with you--no problem.
Super quiet. I think it is just the right size for a bedroom. Easy to clean and fill. I had tried others (honeywell and vicks) and this is by far my favorite

this is 100 percent plastic, makes me nervous dealing with it.  The variable sprays are nice, one is so wide it shoots outside the shower.  make sure you crank on this when fixing it to the water pipe.  I really had to tighten it to keep it from leaking.  One other reader snapped hers on the install, I was afraid the same would happen.  It is a good shower head, not great

This is the last hair straightener you will every buy. Heats up quickly and straightens long, thick and even curly hair in minutes. Haven't stopped receiving compliments since I started using it.

I am having the same problem.  I ordered this product from Amazon on August 26.  It is now October 26.  I have not recieved it yet.  I have never had this problem with Amazon before.  I may have to cancel my order too and go somewhere else.  It is a shame, because Amazon does have the best price I have found so far.  I gave it 5 stars only because I had to give it a rating.  I wanted to be fair to the company, but I have honestly never used one

This item is great. It holds shampoo and conditioner, or whatever liquids you need in the shower, and also has a handy basket that I use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream. The handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth. Really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place. However, I had to buy this item from another vendor because Amazon kept delaying shipment. After the delays had exceeded a month, I finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere. Good product, bad transaction

The monitor is relatively cheap, easy to use, and mostly accurate. The one gripe I have is that if I take my pulse 3 times in one minute or less the rate can range by up to 40 points! Usually, this is not a problem. I tend to check it 3 times and average the 3 which is sufficient for my purposes.

I had been using a spring scale for years and it was fine until I went to a friend's house and saw what I was missing. I put that scale on my wish list that day. This is a lightweight , fairly compact  scale with "on/off" "tare" and "grams/ozs." buttons. it has a clear, plastic,removable bowl for measuring and says it can weigh up to about 3lbs. and down to 1/4 oz. I like it for its slim design its ease of use and for its easy clean up

I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  I've had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!

I used it for the first time on my legs.  I'm not going to lie...It was painful.  I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.

**Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate "cure-all".  Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  Since it's winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  It doesn't hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  I also know that I'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  My legs are smoother and I don't get razor burn!  Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.

Another neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs.  This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth!  I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  Now, I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!

I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks!  Not only have I epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper lip, and on my bikini line.  The results have been better than I could have imagined!!

Again, I'm not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days (I have very thick hairs).  However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I'm never going to have to shave again!  Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  :o)  I epilate there once to twice a week (about a five minute job if you're being careful, two if you're in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms!

I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month.  Now I just epilate.  It hurts, but just for a second.  Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.

**A word of caution: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating "blade".  Now I just make sure that I don't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get them.

This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I've only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  The epilator is very easy to clean.  The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  When it dries, you put it back on.  **Note, the epilator does not store hairs inside of it.  When they are pulled out, they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying.  I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.

I hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator.  I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time.

**Are the few minutes of pain worth it???  ABSOLUTELY!  :o)

By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased. I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results. I can now say that I have found it. I bought the 2" Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair. One of my all time, favorite purchases. I never travel without it

I've had this product for almost a year now.  I have very thick, frizzy, hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months, and blowing drying it straight.  I've never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair.  But with this one, I have not needed a blow dryer since I got it!  Now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life, which I thought I would never see.  Of course this makes it very straight so I can't get any shape or curls from it(which is what I was going for). Cut my drying time by almost 2 hours (as long as I apply some protective serum on when still wet).  Great product and still going strong.

I decided to buy this product before i read the reviews.  In my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind.  There is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place.  The first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard.  I havent had the problem since.
I noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days.  My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly.  The pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem.
All in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one.  I was truly surprised at how well they worked.  I will be purchasing these in the future

Never owned one of these electric jobs before. Could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked. Hated brushing my teeth before and now I will look forward to the experience. Never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point. Why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean?
Everyone should have one.

This model has all the features of the Elite 9500 (2 brush heads, 2 cleaning modes, programmable quadpacer, and a guage to indicate about how much charge is remaining in the battery), but it's $12 cheaper from Amazon!

All the "programmable quadpacer" feature amounts to is the ability to leave it on for an extra (i.e., a fifth) 30-second interval, or the ability to turn the timer off so that it's just on/off.  I regard most of the features as functional ornamentation ("bells and whistles"), but the Elite 9800 also happens to be a dependable, super-lightweight model that will run a good three weeks on a charge with only one person using it.  I went on a three-week trip and didn't bother to pack my charger, and it had charge to spare when I got back.  NOTE: I always allow the NiCd battery run all the way down (to exhaustion) before charging it, and that enhances both the charge and battery life.  (NiCd's only have so many charge cycles.)

If this is your first electric, you might like the way it comes out of the box programmed to gradually ramp-up the power over the first fourteen brushings.

What's the difference between the 9800 and the 9500?  The models appear identical.  The only difference I found is that one comes in a box that says 9800, the other says 9500.  :-)

This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver. So, yes, I like the product. Here's my rundown:
Pluses:
  - Good shave
  - Less razor burn
  - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model)
  - easy to clean
Minuses:
  - Hard to get that "patch" under your nose
  - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight
  - battery/power seem to wane at times
  - packets are expensive
I'm a cheap SOB, so here's my way of stretching out the life of the packets. Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion. Do a first pass shave. Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver. Keep a blade on-hand to get the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns.

I already own a Syncopro Shaver so I decided to get one for my dad. He had been asking about electric shavers for a couple of weeks prior to me purhasing one for him. The reason I choose Braun is because I love my shaver and have never had any problems. Just keep it clean and buy the replacement parts when needed and you'll be ib great shape. I love the way it shaves nice and clean!!!! I trully recommend this product.

I have tried many contact lens solutions, and this one works the best for me.  Since switching to Acuvue 2 disposable lenses a couple of years ago, I noticed that my eyes did not maintain their moisture as well as with my former daily wear lenses.  Some solutions burned my eyes even after rinsing my lenses in saline, but the OptiFree is truly different for me, helping to clean my lenses daily and seemingly helping to maintain their flexibility and comfort all day.  Although I still rinse the OptiFree off of my lenses with saline before wearing them, I have found no irritation.  And, even better, daily rinsing and overnight storage in the OptiFree help me to extend the life of my disposable lenses for several weeks beyond what I could without using it.  That saves money because I have to purchase lenses less frequently.  Give it a try, especially at this price!  Wow

I've only had this scale for a short time, but so far so good.  I've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money. As someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often.  I specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason, with an inexpensive digital scale, which is what I had last, you can't reset it like you can an analog.  This scale is a great buy, for only $10 how can you go wrong!

And now a word from David Lynch, as spoken by Dean Stockwell as Doctor Yueh in DUNE: "The tooth. The tooooootttttttth. Remember the tooth."

Seriously, my daughter loves Dora the Explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes.

I bought this Dora the Explorer battery powered electric toothbrush, and she does.

Game. Set. Match.

Best money I ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction.

When I tested this model on my finger, I was surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit. This electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull, but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing.

Battery life is okay, I estimate it costs about ½ a cent for her to brush her teeth each time. The future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills I'd otherwise have, so this is a money saving unit.

If your child in a member of the Dora cultus, this is one of the better items to own

This small flosses is great. To get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it.

The little plastic floss can break and get stuck between your teeth. Happened at least couple of times so I switch to the string floss

To start - I miss my hair. Last september I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January - and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it that length. (I've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - I couldn't get it out via any other method tried except "growing out"). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get.
My last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck length  - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut, and then layered. That got rid of the really saturated henna'd hair - so I was ready to start growing it out. After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad. I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them. Last night - maybe it was wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day. He knows I've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color. Last night he looked at me and said "Hey wow - you're hair's really grown - I can see a half inch more of the roots! Wow - you're hair is getting dark!"
I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins! I can't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks, come August - if I have another 1/2 inch to add to it, I will definitely be reordering these pills!
But a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day. I find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well.

Hi,

I'm not a "review" person, but when I read the existing reviews, I felt like doing this.
I used this product for 2 months and I must tell you that it really WORKS!
I'm hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further than that. With this product I achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght.
I bought again the product to see how longer it can grows!!!

I've been completely sincere with you...I'm not a staffer of this product company, I'm a real and very happy user!!!

Hope this comment will be helpful for other women. I have only one last thing to say: Try it!!!! It worked for me..

I am in my early 30's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line, chin and cheeks for the past couple of years.  I have tried Murad, Proactiv, AcneFree and many other systems without success.
A month ago I picked up the Neutrogena system when I saw it on sale. Within five days days my skin started to clear.  Now, I have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system. I have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before.  Finally, a product that works and comes at a decent price!

This is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right! Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night. The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for

I have seen these in catalogs before & didn't give them a second thought.  Then one day when I was cleaning under & around all of my shampoo bottles, etc in the shower, it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos/conditions & body wash that I have collected in my shower.  So, I ordered one a higher price & I am so thrilled that I am ordering one for the kids' bathroom where I had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc.  Now it will all be in one place, not messy & out of the reach of my toddler!
The other thing that I have noticed is that I don't use nearly as much shampoo as I did before - I get a few squirts & if that isn't enough, I get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand.  I know I use far less shampoo than I did before I had this so I am no longer wasting it!
This is just the greatest concept & this product is very easy to keep clean & it works & looks great in the shower.
I would recommend this product to anyone!  & if you don't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but I found the 4 section one is just what I needed; one for clarifying shampoo, one for conditioning shampoo, one for conditioner & one for body wash.  No more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom

This dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time. After initially filling the dispensers, it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button. It has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower! It also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need

I received this for Christmas from my Amazon Wishlist. I wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing.

I was a long time user of Norelco shavers, but switched to a blade since I couldn't get a close enough shave. Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can't tell for a few days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue. I typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to give a smooth, close shave. Just a hint, guys. For the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles, dimples and Adam's apple cleanly with very little drag. My only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the 'stash & sideburns while showering. Small complaint that doesn't remove any ratings stars. All in all a great shaver

(....).  It takes some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave.  I got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks, but I think I was pressing too hard like I had to with my old razor.  Just a light touch gives a close shave.  The attachable sideburn trimmer doesn't do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose.  The gel packs go pretty quickly, but maybe I'm using too much.  I'm still trying to get the hang of it.  It's a different experience than your basic razor

   This shaver replaced a Norelco Advantage (6 years old) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days.  I can't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because I haven't shaved with a blade in many years.

    I have used foil shavers in the past (Braun and Panasonic) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it.

    I have been using this shaver for about 3 months.  During that time I have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day.  At first I thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old Advantage which I thought was doing a great job.

   It shaves quick and close ( Personally I think as close as a blade).  When you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry. It doesn't get any easier than that. I have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too.

    The only con is I have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings. Use electric shave before shaving and I think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation.

 Highly recommended and worth the price.

Replacement blades are a must. The razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases. But, if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day, as I do, then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so. The reminder on the razor is only a suggestion, not a command. After all, it does not know when the blades get dull. So, I simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when I feel it is necessary.

One thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin. Until then you may have a little irritation. Another problem I have solved is the hair on my neck. I use to think the harder I press the razor, the better it would get those stray hairs. But, all I got was a rash. I discovered that if I simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness.

Replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you

My fiance (now wife) and I have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.  Her pubic region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold Bond (not together and not in any particular order).  We also tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in the more intimate of areas.  At this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$ and commit to an irrevocable decision.  Although, based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style.

The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.

Just take it easy around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation.

I suppose, although we have no interest in it, that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  Hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner

The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming.

Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive.

If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough

I bought this to try it out based on a friend's recommendation.  Previously I'd always packed a couple old ratty towels with the dog's stuff before heading to the lake or the beach.  Now I only need one towel and it dries like you'd never believe.  I have a 65 pound dog that loves the water.  I make him shake the water off himself (a trick as important as sit or lay down when you have a dog this big) then I towel him dry in less than a minute.  I now own 3 of these towels and have purchased them for just about anyone I know with a dog that gets wet.  We live in Seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes other bodies of water, but we have rainy winters.  Having one of these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god send this winter as well.  I can't speak enough praise about this towel.  Though a $30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem daunting, believe me when I tell you this is worth it.  You'll end up buying two

Okay, I haven't owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years, but I must say, this one is exactly perfect and has everything I would ever want in a hair dryer.  It has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it soft and frizz-free.  I highly recommend this product

The best price around for this type massager.  Price was my main reason for the purchase.  Mine does heat up, but the massager does have to be running for a few minutes before you notice it.  The programmable feature is nice as well as the many variable speeds.  I would highly recommend it.

Just received this massager and my wife and I can't stop massaging each other with it. Especially great deal for the special Amazon price. I've been wanting one of these for years because I can hardly feel those little hand held ones (that just fit in the palm of your hand). Glad I splurged.

Only problem is that Amazon site says "7 heads", Item description says "6 heads", and actul product only included 5 heads. The one missing, from the picture on the box, is the "Acu Point" heads. I'm guessing that's why it's on sale? Still worth it if you get it on sale. Great massager.

I have tried lots of protein powders.  I get online the low-carb, low-calorie protein powders as I am just trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can stomach.  I was stuck on Champions Whey (Chocolate) for the past year as the best but I just got my shipment of the Gold Standard - Cookies & Cream and it is AMAZING!  I love this stuff.  I tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous.  I am going to have this before and after my daily workout, but best yet, rather than binging on any ice cream desires late at night, I am going to get a scoop of fat free frozen vanilla yogurt, put a scoop of this in with some fat free milk and I have my fat free protein shake

I've used hot air brushes for a couple years.  This works better than my last.  The low setting and the larger brush works better for me.  The high setting blows the hair off the bristles.  It's nice having the small brush option for different styles though.  I believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron

I have to write a review for the below review (the one I have in quotes). The below reviewer states this is 170 Watts and you need 1875 watts. I nearly fell off my seat! Not only by the review but by how many people recommended it! FIRST, 100 watts is average for a hair straighter. 170 watts is excellent! 1875 would melt your hair! I did not think it was fair that this person rated the item without having knowledge on wattage.

"This straightener only has 170 watts of heating power. That is not a very good number! If you want salon-straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts... especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair!

I never thought that I could get my hair straight enough to actually like it.  Until I found this VS Sassoon straightener.  It is THE BEST!!  I use it all the time and I love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft.  I would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight, soft hair, to use this product.  You can't go wrong!

I bought this vaporizer several weeks ago. I feel better after I use this. It created steam very fast (about 2-3 minutes after plugging). You may have to fill some salt to make it create a lot of steam. However, a lot of steam means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this vick for a long time(about 12-20 hours), you may not need to use salt

A good product, to be sure...I've used Seventh Generation's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased. This "review" is however a cautionary: while it states on Amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads, it is only rated for 18 loads. Just a heads up!

My first Aquis mitt was rectangular. I like this one better.  Rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand.  Aquis microfiber is the only fabric I use on my face. It is gentle on the skin, yet cleans more thoroughly than anything else I have used. (I find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric!)

If the manufacturer is listening, I would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. This would be perfect for bathing baby/children. There is a slit in the seam, on the thumb side, so your thumb can protrude. You can grip/lift without removing your mitts. Some size choices (S/M & L/XL) would be nice, as this mitt would not fit a large man's han

The roller balls are excellent!  The rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well.  The only drawback is the mesh over the pillow.  It is abrasive to the skin.  I have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem.  The only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly.  Other than that, it is the best machine on the market I have found and I have tried many

Casein is a great, long-lasting protein, perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey.  Casein, in general, is bland (think no fat, no salt, cottage cheese), and harder to mix than whey.  Optimum Nutrition has here a decent casein, that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein I've tried.  The price is ok, but I'd like to see it cheaper (who wouldn't?).  I mix it with whey and use it throughout the day.  I have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor

Yes it is pricey but worth it.

I tried the Gilette skin care and liked it. At that point, $5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy. So when I bought this I thought I must be mad. But for my skin it works fantastic. It also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses. You get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top. Yes you can not see how much is left. But I have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat. At least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get.

I have always had good skin so I do not need that much to have good results. It is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother. Probably the Q10 is a bunch of hype. And yes I usually buy Sauve or 'Swiss formula' which are much less pricey.

I can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces. Under $4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin? Worth it to me

I've had other razors and believe me, this one is the most reliable on I've had! It works well, does NOT hurt? (maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one?) A feature I like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair...unfortunately at times I need this before I use the regular cutter. Battery life is acceptable, power is good, and just a few swipes is all you need. You really can't compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used. This razor, however, has a better level of shaving than other electrics, closer to a blade than the others. In convenience an electric is much better than any blade- you can use it anywhere, dry, just sittin' around

I have Pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble.  The Swiffer Wet cloths are the perfect solution. They're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you're done.  I hate that I'm consuming a product that is so disposable, but at the same time, it works so well

This was almost too strong for me at first.  I put it on the lower level of the house and it took away that "basement" smell for months.  I was impressed with the "throw" this thing had.  I would definitely repurchase.

I bought this item because I was going to Europe for a month. I didn't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time, unless you buy more than one converter kit. You do need a plug adaptor, (these are relatively inexpensive), then you just switch the voltage, plug it in and it works great. I used it in Switzerland, France and Italy. When I came home to the States I just switched the voltage back and I now use it at home. It is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase. I would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad

I purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason:  my old 1875 watt Conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom (the circuit kept tripping), so I was actually looking for a dryer with LESS wattage.  However, I didn't want to sacrifice power, as I hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair.

So far, I've been pleased with this hair dryer.  It does seem a bit louder than my previous model--not obnoxiously so, just a higher, more concentrated fan noise.  The dryer is extremely light and compact; it's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer.  It is very basic, with a choice of high/low settings only (there is no heat/cool option), but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer.

Overall, this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price

Compared to the Conair 1,600W I have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high-pitched when I first turned it on, but you may have a high-pitched blow dryer now--compared to my old Conair--and won't notice a difference. It doesn't have a cold air feature, which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair; or like me, in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable. These two drawbacks, especially having only the hot at high or low setting, is why I give it four out of five, instead of five out of five star rating.

Pluses: price--for $13 it can't be beat for the frugal shopper; efficiency--it blowdries my hair a bit faster than the Conair did though I don't understand the science behind that; appearance--it's cute and compact; weight--a toddler could wield this blow-dryer with ease; carrying ease--small enough to fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag, under the sink, et cetera.

I haven't had this long enough to rate how durable it is, so I hope someone who's owned one for at least a year comes on to write, "it's still going strong.

I have been very satisfied with the monitor.  It is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate.  I was disappointed to find when I opened the box that there were no instructions included.  A quick phone call had them on the way.  I was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time, etc.  All-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device

 I have used the unit for about two weeks, with NiMH rechargable batteries installed, and it performs as advertised. There is, in my opinion, a design flaw: the Start/Stop button acts as the power on{off function, and is easily depressed at unwanted times, e.g. putting into or removing from the case.  They could/should have included an AC adapter

I purchased the Sound Therapy Radio to take on a trip.  My roommate is a snorer, and I figured I needed the sound. I tried it out at home and liked it.  It has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use. The alarm and clock are added goodies for me as I was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel.  It was a good buy for my purposes.

I like the portability and adjustability of this mirror.  It takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly.  It serves my needs very well.  I was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit.  I tend to use the normal mirror more often.  The other is the clock loses it's setting when I stow it away.  It has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature.  As far as I am concerned...I was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock

I tried the ear thermometers and NEVER could get them to work.

Our pediatrician used one of these "rub across the forehead" kind at her office during a checkup and said it was as accurate as the ear kind and MUCH easier to use ... especially when kids have earaches (... grabbing an itty-bitty earlobe and sticking that hard end into the swollen, sore ear canal??? ... ouch.)

With a minute's practice (after reading the instructions), you get the hang of using it and never dread checking temperatures again

I have been using this razor for about 6 years now, probably as long as they have been out. They may be pricey but well worth it. I used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time. I switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little. It is so quick and easy to use, and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams. They do only last for 3-5 shaves, but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream, it's probably not that much more expensive

This has helped my wife and I to lower our cholesterol.  I take it in conjunction with Red Yeast Rice Extract(this must be taken at night) because my numbers are very high.  My wife's numbers are right on borderline.  We took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements.  My numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife's numbers went down about half of mine.  (I also take double the dose she does.)  It's a great way to keep healthy, naturally.  My father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements, also.  His dangerous PSA numbers (prostrate) even dropped radically.  We don't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was.  His dr. said he'd never seen numbers drop that much.  We tell just about everyone we know about it.

I just started taking this pill because I don't have time to eat at the job I was previously at.  It helped a lot!! I did lose 8 pound in 1 week. But when I started an office job, I had more than enough time to eat, but I still kept up with taking the pill.  It helps with my hunger, it really does.  I used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than I can eat!  Now since taking this pill I am sensible with my portions and do not rush to eat as if I'm starving like before.  I agree with one of the reviews, if you still eat when you're not hungry, this pill will not help you.  You have to have the in mind that you want to help yourself eat better, slower and sensible portions.

I have not been overweight for many years, but I still have that last 5-10 pounds that just will not stay off. I have several issues with eating - I tend to eat very large portions when I am really enjoying a meal, I snack a lot, and I have a major sweet tooth. This product has taken care of all 3 problems.

I am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times a day. I plan to cut back a little once I'm at my target weight. I find that this dosage will generally suppress my appetite and/or urge to eat for 3-6 hours.

It's odd for me to experience hunger without cravings and a frantic urge to eat...but that's what the pills do for me. Most of the time I can tell I'm hungry only because my stomach is growling and it has been several hours since my last meal...but I don't feel like I have to eat anything right away. I can go grocery shopping when I'm hungry and not make poor choices, and even when I finish up at the gym after work I don't feel ravenous anymore.

I definitely get full faster. It doesn't feel like it used to when I overate, I just can tell I've eaten enough and I stop. What a concept! And often I can just have a bite or two and be good for another 30-60 min if I'm too busy to sit down and eat.

My urge to snack has really been curbed. I still have one or two snacks most days, but they are much smaller and often more healthy. Now I can actually stay up several hours past dinner without making another mini-meal, which I used to do almost every night.

Hoodia does not completely kill my appetite, it suppresses it quite a bit but more than anything it takes away all of my cravings. That is definitely my favorite part - I used to crave sugar from morning until night practically every day. Since my first day on these pills, the only time I've had sweets is when someone has offered me something. I'm able to eat just a little and not wish for ten times more. It does not occur to me to go to the vending machine at work anymore, or buy candy when I'm shopping.

Maybe even more than the weight loss, the emotional benefits of these pills are incredible for me. I'm no longer berating myself constantly for overeating or having too much candy or dessert. I'm not depressed all day anymore because my favorite pants have gotten snug, and all I can think about is why I don't have the willpower to prevent it.

I would DEFINITELY recommend this product, especially to anyone who has issues with food like I do

This protein is unbelievable. I have tried *many* different brands/varieties and this is without a doubt one of the best out there. It doesn't have the characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste, it's not too sweet, mixes lump-free in cold or piping hot water and packs a punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop. Once you try it, this stuff will definitely become a staple in your pantry.

Beats Axial and Rectal Temps for SURE!

I have a preemie who's temperature needs to be monitored pretty much constantly.  At every diaper change we were taking axial temps with one of those standard digital thermometers.  TORTURE!  Took forever and baby screamed her head off the whole time.  Then my sister got this thermometer for us and it is fabulous.

What we like:
1. When baby is screaming, the light blinks and then goes solid when temp is done, great when you can't hear the beep.
2. It truly does take a second unless baby is thrashing about.
3. Produces a long beep when you are taking your own temperature, no guesswork about when it's finished which is an improvement over earlier models.

What we don't like:
1. Preemies have TINY ear holes.  So we have had to wait till our baby's ear was big enough to be able to use this thing.
2. The lens covers are a pain to switch out and keep on hand, it would be nice if there were a way to just sanitize the lens after each use.
3. We see a discrepancy of almost one degree between the left and right ear which makes us question the accuracy somewhat.  The enclosed brochure explains various causes of this, but that doesn't help when trying to determine what exactly your baby's temperature is.

We have done both the axial and ear temp and found that the right ear on our baby corresponds with the digital thermometer's reading on her armpit.  However, the enclosed chart shows the variances between oral, rectal, axial, and ear temperatures which make it somewhat confusing.  So we alternate between the digital and the ear thermometer just to be sure.

I personally WOULD recommend this thermometer for older babies and kids, just be sure that you test it out when kids are healthy to figure out your baseline and what is normal.  It takes some investigation to develop your method based on what your needs are, but it is a nice, quick to use product and my family LOVES using it for adult temperature readings.  We think we will be happier with it when baby is bigger and we are using it for sick readings only

As a tape measure, it does what it says it does. You press a button and the tape tightens around your body part. You won't have to worry about, "Did I hold the tape tigher last time?" as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time. The tape starts measurement at 2" since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches. I think this tape is accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level

at first i didn't quite get how great this shaving cream is because you have to work a little harder to get it to lather than the other shaving creams or gels i had been using. but once it breaks into a lather, it's great. plus it lasts at least 3 times longer than regular cans of shaving cream/gel. i'm buying this from now on

I was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box. The best part, naturally, is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages. I feel refreshed everytime I used it. It took awhile to get the drainage to stop, but I am glad I purchased this system. It works

First of all, let me say this product is great in almost every way. So if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat, go for it.

My main complain about the Grossan Hydro Pulse is that it is noticeably expensive. Some time ago, Grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a Waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the Hydro Pulse. But then, Grossan decided to produce his own machine and, if I'm right, Viajet is making it for him. Viajet sells the same machine, except for the Grossan tip, at about -again- a half the price of the Hydro Pulse.  The Breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive (I have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country).

So what makes the Hydro Pulse so expensive? Maybe health is a business, after all.

Other than that, like I have said, this product is great for almost any respiratory problem. I used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle, and is intended to use it over 50 times. The Hydro Pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime, so you get the idea.

Also, if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment, look for the Buteyko Method

I'm not a sucker for advertising and I'm definitely not an impulse buyer.  But I did purchase a Schick Quattro razor some time ago to replace my old, tired blade.  And I've been satisfied thoroughly with it.  However, after needing some refills, I bought these Titanium Coated Blades.  Wow.  I didn't believe it at first but I actually took a new titanium blade and the regular Schick blades and (I can't believe I'm about to confess this...) did one of those hokey "side-by-side" tests.  This blade is excellent.  It is an upgrade above their standard blade and, to me, worth the difference in price

I bought two of these for my son....hoping to wean him out of pull-ups at night, without having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident.  This pad is definitely leakproof.  The only con is that even though it says it has an anti-slip backing....that is not the case.  I have tried it with jersey sheets, and flannel sheets...but it does move alot and get bunched up.  So, I do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night.   If I had it to do over again, I would definitely buy the pad with the tuck-under flaps.

Alka-Seltzer got it right and in a big way. Drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment. I prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus.

I bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband.  After the first night I knew I wanted one to put in our RV too.  My husband complained about the smell when I unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years.  He had me order one for his sister for Christmas. I thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now I have purchased four!  This is a wonderful product.  I would recommend it to anyone

I've used the Pigeon brand (I believe it's from Japan) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality bags I've ever used. Unfortunately, they're also very difficult to find. These Lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1/3 of Pigeon's price. Not bad at all! My baby and I travel a lot so I bring along my stock of bmilk in these Lansinoh bags. No mishaps thus far. Highly recommended

I love these bags. They are easy to get out of the container, easy to open and close, and once the milk is in, they stand on their own. To be honest, I haven't tried other brands, so these may not be the only great ones

I've used this product with two of my children with out problems.  I have never had a leak unlike with some of the other brands.  Suggestions: Write the date on the bag before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use labels.  Also, never fill the bag!  It's only meant to hold 6 oz.

These bags are much thicker than the Gerber bags and they are the only ones to have the double zipper. I used these liners with my Avent Disposable system and standard bottles.

I've gone through over 600 of these bags and I must say Amazon has the best price around

These bags are much sturdier and thicker than the Gerber bags.  You also don't have to cut the bags open after defrosting/heating them up.  Amazingly they are cheaper than the Gerber bags too!  I've used them for several months and haven't had one leak yet.  But I am pretty careful and store the milk bags flat in tupperware containers in the freezer

I have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies, I have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks!! My son still fits in the size % diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it, no leaks, no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning!

I used the Huggies Overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training.  I used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull-ups to get him through the night without leaks, but even that didn't work very well.  Finally, Huggies came out with an overnight pull-up - and it really works well!!!  Excellent product

I have had this straightener for a while, and I still have no complaints about it.  It is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener.  I love the heat settings... I only need to put mine on the second setting (338 degrees) for it to do a good job, and I have very thick wavy/curly hair.  I like the 1" because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair, but I'm sure the 2" one is great too

I have had a number of surgeries and injuries over the years.  I see a chiropracter and a physical therapist every few weeks. Both of them work wonders, but then my body tightens up.  I can't afford to see them every day!  I bought the theracane because I saw someone else with one at a long distance cycling event.  Now I've purchased another 3 to share with friends.

It works!  This tool has helped me stay loose, and has taken away a lot of the shoulder stiffness that I have suffered for the past 7 years.  I suggest the addition of the trigger point therapy workbook, which will give you a lot of the details about the body and why/where it hurts.  But even if you don't want to study, you can still get lots of benefits from daily use of the theracane

The knots in my back - my "spots" never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer.  One day I asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was.  He explained the concept, I tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special.   The leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying STRONG pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there.  I bought one the next day.  You don't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots.

   Its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers. It has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it, it shouldnt break. Another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer.
   Just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me. A man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble. My shaving experience with this thing is pleasant...it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer. The only other device I never had/have that problem with is my braun 360 complete (parts of the year I shave, other parts of the year I trim). Its a very nice package and efficient. The only drawback is that it seems fragile...so be careful not to drop any part of this set

This is a fine, well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges--you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom.  It reminds me of tangerine lifesavers, if that helps.

It's a big bar, too, the dimensions of the bar are, in inches:  4 x 2.5 and 1.5 thick

I've had one of these little trimmers for four or five years now.  It does its jobs, and I've have no reliability problems at all.

One word of advice -- don't use it on "the boys" without the little plastic guard or you'll be sorry..

When my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him.  It was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings.  Then I bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out.  Just enough to see your baby by, but not enough to keep everyone awake.  It's been almost a year now, and I'm just about to purchase two more.  We use the light now in our toddler's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine.  We use it every night

What I wanted for Christmas was something to turn my bath tub into a whirlpool, and my boyfriend bought this for me. The bubbles are no doubt amazing, they're plenty strong even at the lowest setting. As for the massage part, I didn't use that too much- it just vibrates some, and the bubbles seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager. The only thing I did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult to keep on the tub floor. It has suction cups, but they didn't work too well- everytime I moved my feet or legs, it wanted to float to the top of the water. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good gift! I will definitely use it many more times

These paper towels are as good as any cheaper paper towels; they are not cloth-like or super thick, but they are as good as any other paper towels you might find for the same price that aren't made of recycled materials.  In short, they are cheap and better for the environment than non-recycled, chlorine-bleached products

After 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise, numerous doctor visits without results, I obtained Source of Life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them.  With the very first dose, I went from dragging around to walking around--while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen.

At my very next doctor's appointment, I told of my experience with Source of Life and I continue to report it to anyone and everyone that mentions being excessively tired.   Members of my family and several friends now regularly use this outstanding product, and have reported similar results.   Not only did I feel much better with higher energy levels, I also notice fingernail and hair growth as well.

I use the liquid version and it is actually very tasty.  I highly recommend this product.  I've used it for 3 years and have obtained consistent good results.

If you wonder why you're feeling lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches you thought was just advancing age, then you might need probiotic therapy.  You might even need it if your resistance to colds is low!

Because we live much "cleaner" lives than our ancestors did, sterilizing our dishes, putting our food in the fridge, and spraying pesticides on everything, we live our lives virtually bacteria-free.  Free of the GOOD bacteria, that is.  The baddies seem to still get us, and without the good ones to balance them out, we're in trouble.

A lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body.  To put it in "nice" terms, it's a little like having backed up plumbing inside you, and the world just ain't gonna be right until you fix it.

I started on probiotic therapy several months ago, and I was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately:

*That little stomach paunch WENT AWAY.  I kid you not.  Talk about an instant self-esteem booster.
*My chronic [men, cover your ears] yeast infections decreased dramatically (even without my eliminating wheat from my diet, which I know I ought to do).
*I had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago.
*I became more resistant to colds than I used to be.

If you're considering supplementing your diet with probiotics, you should know that not all of them are created equal.  In fact, testing done by www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements don't deliver the number of live organisms they claim -- not even close!  Those little creatures are very delicate, and things like processing, shipping, and sitting on your shelf can kill them.  And let's not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them.

Primal Defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to.  (I can tell from its effects on me.)  In addition, it contains lots of good-for-you green foods that also help build that all-important inner strength.

One very important caveat about Primal Defense, though:  Because it's SO effective, don't even think about starting out taking 3 tablets a day!  Not unless you don't mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home.  I took one a day for about 2 months, and then I finally felt ready to move up to 2.  It'll be at least another month before I'm up to the recommended 3.

One more thing:  Drink lots of water.  You need it anyway, and Primal Defense works best when you're well hydrated

Works as advertised and I am happy with it's function.  Much nicer than other battery powered toothbrushes.  One issue is that supposed "quick change" tool to remove the brush head either I can't figure out or it is defective, but once you put it on the brush head a pin is supposed to press into a slot to release the brush head.  It never releases.  Is there a trick to do this?  Also the instructions say put on the tool press in and then pull off the brush head.  The problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in, there is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still attached.  Once you take the tool off the brush head will not slide out.  Anyone figured this out yet

I got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it's great.  I know I should probably replace the head by now, but it still seems to work fine, so I don't.  I've only changed the battery once.  If you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type, this is it.  Then again, if you're not lazy or weak, you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries

I bought this toothbrush a month ago, and have been very satistfied with it. The battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you can't get from a manual toothbrush. The price is good, the battery life is good, and the battery door is very easy to open! I would buy it again!

Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties.

There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil:

Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis.

Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause.

Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure.

Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.

Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation.

Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's "bad cholesterol") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil.

Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer.

Nature Made Flaxseed Oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil.

The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal.

i love these little bibs.  i say little, because even though they are the size of regular cloth bibs, the big size Bibsters, which i also bought, are HUGE, and cover my 9mo. old baby to almost past his diapers.  i was reluctant to buy Bibsters at first, because they seemed such a waste of material being disposable- and i guess they are-- however, they serve a good purpose in that they are extremely light and thin and fully waterproof, so that my super-drooler doesn't get his outfits totally wet like he does with his cloth bibs, which i'm frequently switching out.  Bibsters are also very easy to pack into the diaper bag, and i'm never without a bib. i've also been using the big size bibsters on my 2yr old in the car, for random snack spills.  these are not really reusable, but i sometimes do use them for 2 meals, depending on how clean they are. The price was right when Amazon grocery had the spend 50 get 10 dea

  This is one of those products I'd put on my "must have" list if I had an elderly parent who couldn't handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front door or entrance to any room. For daily touch-ups, these things can't be beat. They are extremely light and get all the stuff that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming.
  Of course, I really believe that a doormat at the front door will go a LONG way in keeping out a lot of the dust and debris. For the stuff that gets by that, use the Carpet Flick. I tend to shake out my runners and deep vaccum them regularly but I've noticed that some people who are elderly don't have the strength for that.
     Because I help out taking care of two people over 90, this has been a great help to them in maintaining their independence and ability to keep things clean when I'm not around...and I'm all for helping people to help themselves stay functional!

I purchased this dryer to replace an older one that is far too loud.   While this new one is much quieter than the old one, it really isn't super-quiet.  Still, I have no complaints on the noise, but the flimsy wall mounting hardware is another story.  The threaded holes in the mounting plate are extremely fragile, so much so that they both were wrung out during the initial mounting of the dryer.  It didn't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it's hard to see thru that white plastic shell.  I ended up having to discard the original threaded screws and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the dryer to the bracket.  This worked fine, but the original mounting hardware isn't very well designed in my opinion.  Other than that the dryer seems to work very well, although I haven't had it long enough to know how well it will last.  All in all, I'd give the dryer 4 stars out of 5

I've owned two Thermaphore heating pads, different sizes, for many years and I'm using one right now! They're quality made to last a lifetime. They trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert. The trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns..if the trigger isn't depressed it isn't heating. I wouldn't be without mine. It helps me manage my arthritis/fibromylagia/nerve damage pain. I've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well.

I am one of the people who just doesn't like applying liquid foundation and cannot do it well, but needs more than just the light coverage of powder foundation. The New Complexion cream foundations do exactly that. I have used numerous cream (or liquid-powder) foundations and this is by far the best and at a good price as well!

The neat little compact includes a mirror and separate storage space for your sponge, which I love because I hate when my sponges become covered in product, all in the same space as a regular compact. I've personally never been one to use compact mirrors, myself, however.

But it's not the package or the sponge which I love, it's the product. It's neither too liquid nor is it too stiff, like some products. It's perfectly creamy and works well with the sponge it comes with.

You really needn't use a lot to have even overall covered but by using more you can obtain a thicker coverage. I find that this makeup blends well with my skin and does a good job of evening out my skin tone, as well, without appearing too much like a mask.

You can feel it a little but it somehow just feels right on my skin. Also, I do recommend using a powder over it to reduce shine.

Overall, I love this makeup

Got my Chillow a few months ago and wish I had not waited so long! It is great! My own personal "thermostat" having gone haywire years ago, I have wished for something to help me sleep and be cool. This is it! First, it allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him away cause he's so darn warm and I just can't take the extra heat. Second, I have wished for a firm pillow forever!! and have tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the Chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm. It can be a bit too cold for a minute or two, but it evens out before long. For those of you who have that problem, you might consider doing what I did. I purchased a "Bedsack" quilted & zippered pillow cover. Put the pillow + the Chillow in that and then in a pillowcase and it's just perfect. Might also help the vinyl scent that some of you complain about. I will agree that the Chillow makes my pillow very heavy, but that is my only complaint. And I'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue.  Other than that, I wish I had purchased one of these Chillows long ago. It is a menopausal woman's dream come true!

I am very satisfied with Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. Many anti-dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough. I have thick, waist-length hair and Nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage. Unlike some anti-dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell, Nizoral has a pleasant fragrance. I'll definitely use this product any time I need a dandruff shampoo

Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo seems to be a very good product. I noticed a difference the first time I used it -- there was no residue on my scalp, and my flakiness was greatly reduced. It produced a very rich lather, also. The only thing I didn't like about it was the possibility that I'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients, but the instructions didn't tell which ingredients might make this happen. I, myself, am sensitive to many products, and didn't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo. I would recommend this product to others

The foot massager is great. It's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like. The massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit. The massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt, raise/lower and etc. The only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it. So keeping it upright can be a bit challenging. But for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet

I picked this up at the store a couple of months ago, and it works well.  I does have a nice light scent initially, and it sooths the face.  It does not have any SPF though, so in summer I used a different balm. But it has been good this winter. Check it out

Saw this product, or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in Cairns, Australia.  It was selling for about $70 Australia Dollars.....which is still quite expensive converted to US$.  I came back to U.S. and found it on Amazon for $15.99, with free ship if I purchased $30.  So, I bought two......one for myself, one for my husband!  It is wonderful!  We wear contacts for distance, so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks, less the neckchains, which always used to get tangled.  It's an ingenius invention

I bought this model 7 years ago for over $100 and it is still running strong although I only use it to clip a small family dog.  Nevertheless, forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal.  This clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action.  In fact, with the right (replaceable) blade, you could use this to cut kids hair as well.  It stays cool, unlike the magnetic motor design.  Use with Oster Kool Lube and you  will never have problems getting a clean cut.  It uses blades by Oster so there is a lot of versatility possible

I was looking for a lightweight simple wet/dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies. The Panasonic WES9941P fit perfectly. Gives a nice shave, and it's so easy to clean. It replaces my old Braun single head linear. (I like the Panasonic better.) The batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge. Give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close

Had one for the last 2 years until I tore the screen. This is the best shaver I have ever used. Shaves fast and clean.Its cheap enough that I will buy another one rather than replace the screen.
Don't like the charger as it is too easy to knock the shaver off of it

This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use.

Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things. Highly recommended.

My husband and I have one drink of Nature's Plus every morning and sometimes at lunch or for dinner.
We started out with Vanilla. I add a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- 1 cup 1% milk and you're hooked!
The ice cubes make it like a real shake.
I have a Vita Mix and that realy makes it blend well. I blend for 30 seconds.
My husband uses the Vanilla with 1 cup of 1% milk - 4 TBS of Ovaltine - a handful of oatmeal- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- blend for 30 seconds and I don't have to cook!
I like the Strawberry. I take a cup of milk (1%)- 6 frozen strawberries- a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots - and 4 ice cubes. Havenly and very satisfying and losing weight to boot!

The product is very good, do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago: The curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes.

But still, we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes. It's a good buy

I bought this bag for my husband as a surprise (as I had bought another brand, and he did not like the Asian floral print).  It's very roomy, looks great, fits ergonomically.  I really love the pocket design and the space that they have, as well as the interior design.  Fits things better than my own bag!  My husband loves it and can't wait to use it!  Plus that, this is the best price I've seen online, and of course, Amazon ships quickly and accurately

There are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments.  I weighed both before I made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments.  I am glad I did.  The light from the mirror is bright, the slide bar for the different light settings works very well.  If you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time.  I enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use.

The only negative I have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but I am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out.

Pacific Northwest
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I bought this product specifically because it was originally described as being/having "mood-brightening Natural Spectrum light." I thought it would help on the gloomy Pacific Northwest winter days. I got it on a Friday sale price, so it seemed like a good value for the product description given here.

The lamp just arrived (a few days ago - when I originally submitted this review), and the product's FAQ sheet states this product is "designed only to provide excellent quality light for daily tasks and hobbies. This lamp does *not* offer the correct level of light intensity specified by the National Institute of Mental Health for the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.).

The product literature packed with the lamp has no mention at all that this product offers "mood-brightening" light. Because of this glaring misrepresentation, I am currently debating whether to the return the lamp.

I agree with the other reviewer that the adhesive labels (there are two) are VERY sticky and difficult to remove completely. I used a combination of methods to remove the adhesive residue.

And I agree with the comments about the company name being printed on the front of the lamp. When I saw it in the picture, I thought it had to be some kind of company watermark or logo for the stock photo ONLY, so I was shocked to see "Verilux" actually printed/embossed into the lamp housing, in a very prominent location on the front of the lamp. Very cheesy, for a lamp of this price point and quality.

If you're looking for a "clean" bright light, in a stylish, portable lamp, this is not a bad choice. But if you're looking for a full-spectrum light that does offer some light "therapy," this is probably the wrong choice. The company does have other, "therapeutic" lighting options, but at a higher price point.

Nov 1, 2006 UPDATE - I was concerned enough about the original, misleading product description that I submitted my concerns to Amazon. I now see that the description had been revised since submitting those concerns. I want to thank Amazon for their very prompt response in correcting the product description, which should help other buyers make a more-informed decision.

This is a useful tool in that it makes the software/hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other I am aware of.  My only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output, although from reading Heart Math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing.  However for the price it is definitely worth it and I could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack

I just bought a Vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high.  I needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet.  These goggles are awesome!  They fit perfectly inside my helmet, and because the wrap around my head, they stay put.  The magnets in front are very strong so the goggles don't move.  The eye cups are just the right size and they're padded for comfort. These goggles have far exceeded my expectations.

I love all the varieties of chocolate, and if you mix them in a blender, they are smooth and creamy.  You can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes, and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake.  Shaking by hand or using a hand-held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice.  These are a great meal replacement - healthy, nutritious, and full of quality protein.

I haven't used it thoroughly yet. But from what I have seen so far, it is a pretty good scale to track your everyday fat loss progress. I am satisfied with this purchase for the price and quality and ease of use. I use it daily to track my body fat % and weight. So far used it for only myself. Haven't checked it out for more than 1 users

this thing is really cool and works very easily.  Once you perform
the 10 minute setup and enter your info (once), you just step on
it and tell it what setup number your are and it takes and saves the measurement.  It seems very steady and well built and I think it should last a long time

The best part about my ijoy 130 is the price I paid.  Day after Xmas Linens and Things had only the floor model left.  Got 20% off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10% off.  30% off made the chair $500 instead of $700.  I am in it as I write this!!!  Very nice and relaxing.  Sometimes the "percussion" setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it's great.  I would agree that I wish it went a little further up the neck.  I just sit a little lower in the chair for it.  Not sure if it's worth $700 just because that's alot of money but I've got no problem with $500.  I think my wife and I will get alot of use out of it

This handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills.  It is easy to set up. Just put in the # of hours between your doses, 12 or 24 hours for twice a day or once a day medications. I use two of these. The timer counts down the hours and then chirps. When you silence the alarm, it automatically starts the countdown again.
The storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when I travel. Most of the time, I just use it to remind me to take my pills.
I wish I knew about this a long time ago

I'm a vain, 39 year old male and started using this product (in combination with another highly regarded anti-wrinkle product) about three months ago. This daily application replaced a daily application of facial conditioner/moisturizer. I was hoping some barely noticable forehead wrinkles would go away. No such luck. I notice a definite reduction in wrinkle depth in the morning, before I shower, but by mid-day, the wrinkles have returned to their normal state.  Does this really work?! I suppose the only way to truly find out if this stuff works is to use it on only half the face and see the effect over time. In all fairness, I must mention that my face now routinely feels softer and smoother and less oily than before. That's why I rated this product a four instead of a three. But the frickin' wrinkles are still there!  Let me see all that clinical research all these skin care experts are touting.

This product does wonders. It helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week. Like another customer, I have sensitive skin. I didn't feel this dried my skin out at all. But a word to the wise, make sure to read the directions carefully, this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints. If used properly, its fantastic

First of all I am in my early 20's so I haven't much experience in night creams.  I just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness.  I use "moisture therapy cream" by Olay in the morning before I put on my makeup, and then I use this at night.  My skin always feels so soft, more soft than I think it ever did.  I can't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier.  The scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to.

I would recommend this product to anyone of any age.  It has a good price compared to everything else on the market and I believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun.  Prevention is key

Well, let's FACE it..short of any procedure that is invasive(botox,cosmetic surgery, etc), there really isnt any magic cream that is going to reverse the aging process, but there are a number of products that will aid in improving the look, feel and texture of your face. I've been trying out several of the products out there, and I found "Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream For Face and Neck" to be one of the best ones around.

I really like this one alot because of the many benefits it has all in one jar. After using it pretty generously for a little over a month(I've used about 1/2 the jar so far), I found it worked wonders on improving the look and feel of my skin. It minimized the appearance of fine lines, really hydrated my dry skin, improving on firmness, absorbed deep into my skin, so using it every night, I could still feel the softness the next morning, and left my face feeling very smooth to the touch. I especially felt and saw visable result around my neck and throat area(where I am really starting to get that over 50 look).

It has a nice, very light scent, and here's the best part... The price here at Amazon is about 1/2 of what I paid when I purchased it along with my groceries at the market(and it was even on sale at the store), so at around twelve dollars here right now, it's a real bargain.

There are 7 benefits listed on the box, some I mentioned above, others include evening skin tone, minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces the appearance of blotches and age spots. Give this one a try for any of these aging signs.

Don't expect a miracle. The wrinkles will not vanish, but a nice improvement in the look and feel of your skin, a healthy glow that leaves you feeling just a little better about yourself(and a a great price).

The formula includes a fast absorbing skin strengthener called VitaNiacin(Vit B3, Vit E and Pro-Vit B5),wheat protein and hydrators.

I like it and recommend it.....Laurie

I love the Medi-beads products, and highly recommend them.  Although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto-gel, I love the moist heat and the weight of the pads.  I used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients.  I only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back, but 2 of the king-sized pads will do it.  Microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave.

I've been wearing glasses for almost 25 years now.  Its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that doesn't either streak or damage the lenses -- especially with AR and other coatings they put on glasses these days.  The Sharper Image eyeglass cleaner does the trick.  It also, by design, cleans your frames which is a plus.

I would have given 4.5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply.  Its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses.  I have two pair (regular and sunglasses) so no real fault there.  I recommend getting a 3M microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied

I love the smell of an essential oil in the air. I've tried tealight burners, a smear on a low-burning lamp, and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy. The PearlEssence Spa Mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time. Because I live in a humid climate, I was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture. The cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air. The light show of the base can be turned off, but I like it most of the time. Product was offered for $10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain, and shipping was free with my order over $25 with other products.

The sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful! It does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it. And it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours. The light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well

I've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and I have just finally begun to run out. While I don't use it everday, I use it regularly and when needed.

I use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated. This Nivea after shave is wonderful. It only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck. It leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling. Sometimes I'll leave the house and forget to put it on, and I'll go all the way back just to put it on. It gets your day off to a great start. No funky smells or textures here. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed

Unfortunately, millions of Americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress, anxiety, and depression. In the pharmaceutical industry, anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market.

The everyday stressors faced by Americans have simply become too much for many to bear, and reasonably so. In recent years, taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin. However, the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently.

In the past year, some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light, much to the horror of patients and physicians alike. Anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction, severe withdrawal, weight gain, vertigo, and even suicide and death. To treat the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, without negative health implications, many are now turning to natural supplements -- safely and with much success.

Most consumers are confused about which natural stress, anxiety, and depression supplements to take. Fortunately, there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results, safely. The challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one's that are based more on marketing hype. It is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study, and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product. This is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress, anxiety, and depression.

After researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today I can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective. There are a few, however, with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses.

These products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress, anxiety, and depression. After review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended, Here is a list of the Top The Top 10 Stress, Anxiety and Depression Supplements On The Market Today:

1) Anxietol 7(tm)
2) Welatonin(tm)
3) Pinadol(tm)
4) Seredyn(tm)
5) Prosera(tm)
6) Amoryn(tm)
7) Euphorx(tm)
8) HerbVal Supra(tm)
9) Clarocet-NRI(tm)
10) Relora(tm)

If you don't like getting attention, these are not for you.  I'm often surprised by people's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off; I'm so accustomed to pulling them apart, that I forget how unusual the viewing public finds it.

I have been wearing Clics for nearly a year.  I pretend that I don't need glasses, but of course I do and have for nearly a decade.  Popped the standard diopter lenses out, and put in my bifocal prescription.  It worked great, despite a warning from my optical shop.  (And even if they had broken from the experiment, the price is right:  I could try it again.)

Previously I was wearing glasses on a chain.  Besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer, I also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching. Then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break.

I call the color of mine "magenta" - which may or may not be the same as the online "red" - I bought them in a shop (**gasp**).  My short hair is not a problem, but I agree that reading in bed doesn't work.  So I use a different pair for those occasions

After a few months of debating whether or not I needed the extra light for my work space I made the great choice of purchasing the HappyLite.  I've been using it the past few weeks and have really enjoyed how it brightens up the dark corner better than a regular lamp.

Now my only concern is how to order an extra bulb.... (guess I should read the materials it came with).

I bought this for my father-in-law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old.  My mother-in-law at sixty seven, doesn't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and cannot wield a full-size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry.

The light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments.  I wouldn't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however.  It's not as easy to use as a full-size standard wheelchair.  This is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage

Lightweight, easy to transport, easy to put together.  Just remember, the person in the chair cannot maneuver on their own.  Someone must be able to push.  But what a great product

I've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years, both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation, and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed

I got into Aquis microfiber towels because my aged mother does not have the arm strength for big fat terry towels.  I then bought some for myself because besides being light they absorb like crazy -- one swipe and you're dry.  I decided to get one of the 'adventure' line because information was that they are like the dog-drying towels which are very like the lisse crepe ones.  What I didn't realize was not only I buying a very nice towel, it comes in a very nice little nylon zippered bag, mesh on one side to facilitate drying.  We're talking the sort of little bag you'd spend about $5 to buy from a travel gear catalog.  I was thrilled to pieces.  Also in keeping with the 'adventure'-travel theme, these towels have little tags on one corner that can be snapped back on themselves to form a loop to hang the towel from.  Very handy for camping, meaningless but not annoying for home use.  I like how the loop normally is just a long tag so that the loop does not tangle in the washer

This product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair. This has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron! I would give this product 10 stars if it were available! My hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by Chi.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone

I am 100% satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what I paid for. I am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own, where as for a complete trim, I do need my wife's assistance. If you trim on a regular basis, ie., when the hair's not over grown, you will definitely find the job more easier.I recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts. The price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon, else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the Thanks giving sale

We purchased eight of these (6 - 3/4 in. and 2 - 1 in.) for our beauty salon in 1994, and we've never used another brand since. With their quick heat-up time and multi-level heat options, these irons perform superbly for precision curls.  I was so pleased their performance that I bought one to use at home to replace my fancy Vidal Sassoon gold barrel, which only had two heat settings - Too Hot and Burnt Scalp.  The heating element is so efficient that Level 1 or 2 is probably sufficient for most home users.  Rarely did I have to set the iron at Level 4 or 5, and never above 5.  It takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up.  Four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use.  At the price we paid, our weekly cost averaged out to pennies.  If you purchase this product you will -NOT- be disappointed

These are hands down, the most awesome pillows, we have ever owned.  They were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed pillow" for $60 just sounded silly.  What brought me back around to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had been on for the perfect pillows.  One of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow.  We spent a year, buying this pillow and that pillow, all to no avail.  Then one day I rolled the dice, and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers.  The covers actually make the dish.  These are the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!!  These pillows rate 10 stars!!!  Just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had.  I do not work for, nor own this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up exceptionally well.  They recommend you change the water every six months or so, depending on what type of water you put in.  The pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water being the bottom layer.  They seal tight and do not leak. There is no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess air.  These pillows and of those Black & Decker scissors, have to be my two best finds for 2006!!

I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal

I bought this dryer based on other people's review.  It is an excellent dryer.  The air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers...however, since it dries my hair fast, my arms don't mind the weight. :)  2 thumbs up in my book!!

In the past, I bought hair dryers at Target because of the prices. I had no idea that a few more bucks can buy you a quality hair dryer that surpasses any Conair, Sassoon, etc. purchased at this and similar stores.

The difference in the quality is noticed immediately upon use. Although the BB Pro is a little heavier than I'm used to, it dries hair faster and with fewer frizzes. It's amazing

I purchased this dryer for my wife. It took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with 1600 to 1850 watts power setting. My wife's hair is thick and long, so she didn't want get anything below 2000 watts. This one is light, powerfull and handy.
I strongly recommend it

I did a great deal of research on the Internet for the "best" shower filter. I was concerned about the filter not lasting, losing water pressure, etc. I came across the Aquasana on amazon and read all the great reviews on it... After ordering it, I am so glad that I did. It was really easy to install and I honestly feel like the water pressure coming out of it is BETTER than with my old shower head. The shower head swivels and has several different settings, like massage, rainfall-type flow, etc. It really does feel like you are showering in spring water. Just the idea of showering in chlorine-free and mineral-free water is refreshing in itself. I am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone living in an apartment who wants filtered water and who cannot install a filter on the main line.... It's a little pricy but well worth it.

I am so happy with Aquasana Shower Filter. I live in a building where the water is so harsh and sometimes discolored. As a consequence, my skin shortly turned dry and I continuously got skin problems. I even thought about buying drinking water to clean my face everyday. Now that I have found Aquasana, I feel so happy. It does what it promises. I could feel the smoother skin by just using it from the first time. And it did feel like showering in natural spring water. I couldn't be happier with this product

They had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and I stayed at and I fell in love with it! I HAD TO HAVE ONE OF MY OWN and thanks to Amazon I was able to find one. This is an EXCELLENT product. My husband installed it easily and I would never be without one again. One side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good, lol, and eyelining is a breeze. Though he would never admit it, my husband uses also (trimming mustash, nose hairs (eewww), shaving, etc.)
Great product. Order one. You will not be dissapointed!

Not a bad product.  Irritates the skin a little, but does remove your hair.  The only things I don't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks.  It does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places.  Not a bad product; however, I hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time.  I would recommend this product

Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford laser and wax just isn't my thing.
Grabbed this for myself before Christmas on a whim. It was money well spent!
After 3 months of use, I have gotten the hang of the product. I suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more. Say, run the product over each leg once till you get used to it. Then trying to completely remove the hair. My legs are unbelievably soft. No rash, one little tender area after I spent too much time there. Do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case. I still have trouble around my ankles.
Hair regrowth is markedly thinner since I began using it. By about half. What remains still grows long but I'm, err, what does one call this process? - doing it once a week and only takes a few minutes

Really strong when just sprayed, but after a little while it gets soft, but at the same time not too soft. The perfume lasts for few hours, by the time I go to bed, the scent would still be there faintly, and I fall asleep to it. It is fresh and strong at first, then soft and sweet. LOVE IT

I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months before they even shipped the product, because it was the first reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD.  Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends.
Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most.
I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me

I first used this product when I got a straight razor shave in a men's salon awhile back.  It really made for a smooth shave, which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave.  By the way, I don't recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as I foolishly did.  Your face will be very sore.  It took me 10 years before I got another straight razor shave, and I hated it as much as the first time.  I'll never get another.  However, this oil product made the shave tolerable, and it makes daily shaving fantastic.  This combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave.  It's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward.  Buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave, and you won't be disappointed

I got the WaterPik JP-130 to replace a shower head that was set too low for my husband.  Installation was easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to get a good seal.  Other showerheads I've purchased have come with the tape included which is why I took off one star.  The arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall.  It creates a soft fall of water that I really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim.  I've not had any problems with the thumb screws and I have been move the unit quite often so that I can shave my legs.  I've loved this product so far and would definitely purchase again.

I got this showerhead for Christmas and am really happy with it!!  It's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you.
I do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place.  But with mine anyways it stays in place while I'm using it and it's only later that it slowly lowers down.  Then I just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when I want to use it.  It hasn't been any trouble so far.
I love this showerhead so much that I'm actually already looking for an even larger one!!  I highly recommend these "rainfall" showerheads!

Im a truck driver that dosent drink coffee. Can you believe it!?
My hours are really weird as my day may start at 8AM or at 8PM & I might work for 10 to 14 hours per shift. Ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a time & have always gotten the boost I need to get where Im going. I also may use it to start my day or to finish it.
I started using 5 hour about 6 months ago. I dont use it everyday but when I need it, it works well. The nice thing is, when I finally call it a day I can lay down & get to sleep. Unlike other products Ive used, I dont have that ragged feeling afterward.
I purchase in quantities of 100 & carry 25 or so on the road.

I have owned and broken most grabbers on the market. The fold-up Gopher is a joke, another, with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use, and the heavy-duty unit from Lowes is hard on the wrist. This unit is the smart way to go! It is strong and durable and makes the most sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers and relieves pressure from the wrist. Also, it is exactly the correct length for a six foot man. No bending at the lumbar required

My mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds... birds.. ect. But all those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white noise...and the waves inevitably break and the birds stop chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street. This is the only sound we need!
We bought it for our 3 month old daughter because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors kept waking her up. She slep great from day one... now we use it as part of her bedtime ritual.. bath, jammies, book, SLEEPY MACHINE... and off to sleep she goes

We originally got this to replace the "fan noise" in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold.  The first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it.  We've discovered it's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night.  With the adjustability dials it's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan.  It doesn't however, cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise, especially for children

This is the best sound machine out there.....I worked in a doctors office where they used these, and they were amazing.  My husband cannot sleep without some sort of "white noise".  We purchased this and our sleep couldn't be better.  Best bet for the money.  It's also adjustable as far as volume, just twist the top.  Very quick shipping as well.

I don't know why most of the reviews are so negative.  Mine works perfectly, it does not flip-flop, does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience.

Reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have what is called a "diverter valve" attached to my shower head.  The waterpik is meant to be installed DIRECTLY onto the shower head itself.  I could not do that, because I have a portable "wand" that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to.

Went to Home Depot and got an extension and a coupling, kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to "interface" the waterpik via the extension, via the coupling ONTO the diverter valve..... Wow!  NO LEAKS!  Works PERFECTLY.

For those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option, go to Home Depot, Lowe's or a hardware store and what I wrote above will work as it did for me.

Enjoy

I purchased this size ramp to handle wheelchair access over the two-inch threshold to our house and it has done that, but I wish now that I had selected a size longer than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline. I use a power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the chair's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the top of the ramp due to the slope, necessitating careful maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house. It was easy to install, however, with the included mounting screws and seems sturdy and durable

My hair is very wavy and frizzy, I have to condition my hair every day so it doesn't look dry and damaged. 2 weeks ago I got my hair cut, the stylist used a Sedu straightener on me. Wow! Suddenly, my hair was stick straight and super glossy (really brought out the natural highlights). I bought one from him for $199 (should have checked the Internet first).

I've tried a cheap flat iron before; after wrestling with it for 40 minutes and pulling the heck out of my hair, all I got was slightly "pressed" hair.

The Sedu iron has super smooth ionic plates, so it glides through your hair very easily, quickly and smoothly. No more pulling of my hair. I can give myself smooth, gorgeous, in about 5 minutes. Another plus is that the style will stay until the next time you wash your hair; Now i only have to straighten my hair every other day.

Sure, Sedu is on the expensive side, but this salon-quality tool is more than worth it. Look good and feel good every day!

I read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu.  It took me a week to get the product and I anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived.  I must say that the products is a dream come true.  I am an African American woman and I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when going to the salon.  When I went back to work from the weekend, my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked (because it was truly straight).  I would recommend this to any woman.  I have not been back to the salon in the last 2 months

Calvin Klein's Obsession was one of the earliest releases in the designer fragrance craze, and it has since become a classic.  Obsession is a warm, earthy, sensual scent.  There is no floral or sweetness to it; rather, it has a musky, almost masculine quality with a bit of a vanilla note.  The scent is gently seductive--alluring enough for romance, but also subtle enough for everyday wear.  In has excellent staying power, as it lingers on the skin all day long.

Although Obession has all of the qualities I usually like in a fragrance--I definitely prefer musky, spicy scents to more floral ones--for some reason, Obsession is not one of my favorites; although I do enjoy wearing it on occasion, I actually prefer stealing some of my husband's Obession for Men to wear for myself!  Overall, however, Obsession for women is a classic fragrance that I would definitely recommend

I've been using this for the last 3 months and I'm a very satisfied customer. I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors. I'm Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown   hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic. It's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me I've never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers. I'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming

I was having a problem with over-eating and eating when I wasn't hungry and as a result, gained quite a bit of weight, and felt awful.

I've only been using this product for three days, but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up.  I haven't felt jittery or shaky.  I feel better than I have in months.

I would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un-needed weight

This product was nothing short of miraculous for me.
I'm in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since I hit my teens...and while I have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea (which started about age 40), including retin A cream,  topical and systemic antibiotics, and every sort of over the counter cleanser, these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as I aged.

I've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it's been in many years....I had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it.

Caution - I've never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity. People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably won't have the same kind of experience I do.

BP creams have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which really gets down in the pores.

I use it heavily.  I apply it either before I brush my teeth or before I get in the shower.  It is cool and refreshing.  I usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before I rinse off, although sometimes I use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after I've walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke.

It leaves my skin very, very  clean,  and *soft.*  I have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all...indeed, my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time.  The dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me.  it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin.

Working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.  Now before cleaning or working I will actually put a bit of this mask on- wne I am done,  my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity... I stay clear and smooth.  I guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria.

I do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life.   The benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me.  I simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth, and wash it off.  No prescriptions, no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me.  Amazing!!!

I was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but I am so glad I did. This one gives me a really good shave. I have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since. Another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud, which it is but since you turn it on and leave it, I just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem.

I bought this Obus Forme king sized pillow because I thought it might stop my snoring.  I must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely.

There have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first.  I found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics, but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive.

My wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it.  I have just ordered a second pillow.

I bought this straightner at Walmart for about the same price found on amazon and I really like it.  I bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does.  I wanted a chi, but I couldn't pass this one up for the price.  I 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well.  A good product for the price!!

NV diet pills are working great for me- I lost 8lbs in a month!!! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills. It isn't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and don't work out, of course nothing is going to happen. They really do control hunger because I take 2 a day and one day I was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and I was STARVING looking to eat anything and everything in sight

Having struggled with digital scales that broke after a few years, I finally decided to get the scale my doctor has.  It's terrific because I can see it clearly (the numbers are right in my face) and it is built to last forever! My daughter and I assembled it with a minimum of effort. The directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy to handle. It is clearly the best scale I've ever owned.  The down side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor scale.  You can, however, buy a piece of plywood and put the scale on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom can't handle the bigger size

I read in one of the magazines, that many stars in Hollywood eat chocolate
to lose weight. I thought, that was some kind of cruel joke, until I read
that the chocolate they eat is with hoodia, but I could not find the name
for those chocolates.
I searched the internet, and was I happy to find Chocoleans!
I was going out on a date to my favorite sushi place, and had one  chocolean
before I left the house.
It worked! I could barely finish two sushi's  and I felt soo full.
Now I  eat one or two chocoleans a day with water or coffee, and eat soo
much less!
I already lost two dress sizes, amazing.
And, they are sooo delicious

My kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and Blue Lizard does the trick!!!  I don't think they got burnt one time last year while I was using this.  Great Product!!

These are the best diapers I have used. They are soft, flexible, and easily adjustable for a good secure fit. They hold leaks extremely well. Of course leaks do occur (why wouldn't they if your baby has, say for example, 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes....it's happened), however this is to be expected. They do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy, but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection. I HIGHLY recommend these

The magnet is solid, the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows.  Lenses are clear and functional.  However, they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads, since it can get snug and this is NOT your usual glasses.  Notice that the frame encircles the head, making head size an issue.

On the plus side- the glasses won't fall off when you bend forward, they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em, and they are functional

I had my original clic readers for about six years before I had to replace them. I love the quality of the lenses, the ease of use and the fact that I do not have to remember where I put them when I took them off. I never take them off and have even  ordered several pair for other people at work. I am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that accumulates on them once in a while, find them to be one  of the most useful tools I own.

If you don't like getting attention, these are not for you.  I'm often surprised by people's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off; I'm so accustomed to pulling them apart, that I forget how unusual the viewing public finds it.

I have been wearing Clics for nearly a year.  I pretend that I don't need glasses, but of course I do and have for nearly a decade.  Popped the standard diopter lenses out, and put in my bifocal prescription.  It worked great, despite a warning from my optical shop.  (And even if they had broken from the experiment, the price is right:  I could try it again.)

Previously I was wearing glasses on a chain.  Besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer, I also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching. Then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break.

I call the color of mine "magenta" - which may or may not be the same as the online "red" - I bought them in a shop (**gasp**).  My short hair is not a problem, but I agree that reading in bed doesn't work.  So I use a different pair for those occasions

These glasses are a great idea.  However, they do not work with long hair.  The back "strap" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair

I like this product a lot. My hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath. I used this product and my hair looks good now. It looks smooth and straight now and I can feel the softness when I touch my hair. I definitely will recommend this product to my friends.....

omgosh i cannot tell you how much i love this straightener. it makes my hair SO SOFT its like baby bottom soft or when u sand wood for a really really long time. i LOVE it. i use it everymorning.. at night i use the wet setting to dry off my hair and then in the mroning i finish it off with the dry settting. but i also use sunsilk pink bottle 24/7 creme. its an absolute must-have.
to the person who gave it one star.. maybe yours was a defect. im sure everyone else who has rated it so far loved it. did you straighten it section by section? it doesnt work if you do it all at once.

i recommend this straightener! its not that expensive and also makes a great christmas gift. looks nice too.

enjoy

I've been relying on this lotions for over a decade.  Of the many I've tried, it's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long-lasting moisturizing.  Some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive, especially on hands, but if you have skin as dry as mine you'll tolerate a minute or two of "greasiness" for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours.  These comments are for Neutrogena Emulsion only -- Neutrogena Body Lotion did not work well for me

Over the past two years I have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs. At age 70 those needs are many. After approximately two rounds of trying, it is Miracle Greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs I have for feeling better in general

I saw these reading glasses on CSI:NY and just had to have them! It's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses...and the WOW factor doesn't hurt either! I've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses. My hair is shortish (layered to the bottom of my neck) and I wouldn't want it any longer if I was going to wear these glasses a lot...which I do! They aren't portable...but they aren't supposed to be. I keep mine in my office where I need to take them on and off the most frequently. I'll probably get another pair for home but I'll used my old ones I can put in my case for carrying in my purse. All in all...I'm very glad I got them

This isn't a product thats going to get you laid after she sniffs it a couple of times. It's starts the chat and dialog.   What it does do is start the conversation and keep you the their target. M-11 kicks up the yackity yak in her with you being the focus. I;ve tried a few of them including that 90 dollar rip off thats advertised in Popular Science, and this is  product works just fine. Give it a go guys. It gets you past that awkward dork moment when you are trying to talk about somthing other that what Starbucks you hang at. Its not a sex pill so forget it. But, it will open up the road you need to walk down to get to the garden of eden or whatever. So don't be a little whimp. Be a man and give it a go. Its a way to the women you want via the mental route. Yes, you have to think. It will work for you so do it

I wanted a cordless shaver because at my age (49) I need my glasses on to see the hairs I'm shaving, and that doesn't work well in the shower!  This Braun is a good buy, easy to use, and works well if you follow the directions and shave slowly.  It's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving gel, but it's quicker and less mess, so I think it's a good trade-off.

The Ultrasonic Aromatheropy Fountain is really unique.  The sound generated, yet unheard, causes water to spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like water sound. At the same time, the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on. All the while, led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors.  The construction was just a little light duty other than that, Very Nice

I've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem.  Sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works.  Never falls apart and cut hair great.  I'd buy another if this one would ever wear out!

Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean.

The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available

I really like this curling iron...- and you definitely can't beat the price!  It heats up very quickly, and gives me great curls.  The key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair.  Then, after you curl, make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting to lock the curls down.  I always receive so many compliments on my hair!!

I am a big fan of 2" curling irons, but they can be difficult to find.  My last one (different brand) wore out a couple years ago and I had a hard time finding a replacement until now.
I have shoulder length hair, fairly thick, plus wavy and frizzy.  2" curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair, while also turning it under (or up, if desired) at the ends for a nice, finished look.  I find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat/straight iron while achieving superior results.  You will not get "curl" with this curling iron.  You will get smooth hair quickly and easily.  Highly recommended

I was searching for a two inch curling iron for a while. I have had so -so dealings with Gold N Hot in the past so I was a little nervous but I purchased this one anyway. So far, so good. It's surprisingly light (at least compared to my one inch ceramic tools curling iron). I usually let my hair air dry and use my curling irons to straighten my hair as I curl the ends (I'm black with a relaxer.) I have yet to do it with this one. Although I might try b/c it gets really hot. (I usually have it on around 20-25 out of 30)

The only problem is that the ceramic can chip off (It happened with the first one I bought, but I returned it and got a new one that hasn't chipped so far) and it's so big that if you take your thumb off the spring grip, it can be hard to get it back on (I have huge hands too.

Sedamine is great sleep aid. I've been dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and I tried nearly everything including old remedies-I thought I would go crazy if I didn't find help. Not sleeping has been awful. Since end of July I started with the Sedamine product and it started working right way. I tell anyone to try it cause it help me it help anyone.

I have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store, with school and all it's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight. I've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me, no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days I have class early!

the pills really do work.  I stopped taking stacker over a year ago and i stopped my routine workouts and i gained 40 lbs in just one year!  I was so frustrated and dissapointed at myself so i started going to the gym but i was finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything while at the gym.  I just started taking stacker3 for one week and already i have dropped almost 10 lbs (of course with excersise as well)  This pill not only helps with energy but as i have read, it also works as a metabolism enhancing property! Thank you NVE for a great product.  THe only negative thing about it is that i sometimes feel dizzy and a numbness to my fingers.  (that was the reason i stopped taking it in the first place but its really not life threatening or as serious as it may sound)

We have a "closet shower", which made it difficult to get out of the way of the water spray (not to mention having water spray out the door).  We picked up this neat little shower head, and we're much happier now.  You can avoid the water more easily (for shaving, washing body, etc.), and since it aims straight down, no more turning the shower head all the way to the side to avoid it going right out the door.  It's inexpensive, and has made our shower experience much better.  I definitely recommend it

Wow!  I'm really impressed!  I've had trouble cleaning under my bridge.  I can fish floss under there and clean it good, but it takes a lot of time.  Now I just blast it clean in minutes.  It does a good job of cleaning my back teeth.  I've never been totally satisfied with just flossing.  Now they feel perfectly clean.  I love this device!  It doesn't replace flossing.  It does a great job under the gums, but I still feel cleaner after flossing.  It's great as a between brushing "touchup".  I recommend it to anyone.  My mouth hasn't felt this clean in years.  I feel like I've come from the Dentist after a cleaning.  Thats a great feeling to have every day

It's pretty good...don't see it making anything "firmer" but it works nicely as a moisturizer.  I checked the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has been posting the same thing [about it ruining their life] all over the net.

Probably an allergic reaction, you always have to test a little piece of skin before slopping something in your eyes ;

I found this product to be very unique, and helpful, in that I could quickly remove & retain the glasses around my neck.

Being far-sighted, I have come to need reading glasses, and these are perfect for my needs.  I can look 'down' through them, and look 'over the frame' for distance, all while they are secured around my head and neck.

I do hiking, using a GPS device, and these glasses allow me to look down at the GPS device in my hand, while also looking forward towards my path of travel.

Thank you for the innovative product

My husband was leaving more than 20 pairs of reading glasses everywhere and any where and could still never find a pair when he needed them....even to ead a menu! These glasses are the answer to anyone who wears reading glasses. I bought them in all colors for him and even bought a pair work a friend who works with him(he loves them as well and bought in more colors also). Neither of them have lost a pair in all of these months. They also have started so many conversations. Everyone who has asked about them has done the same and have bought in all colors. It takes a little adjusting and getting use to but everyone we know has never returned a pair. Only reason they have returned was to order in more colors or to order for friends and loved ones! These glasses are fantastic! Thanks for the great service

I love the idea of the glasses always being where I can find them.
The only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide         the band is.
Every time I look up the magnets pop apart.
If they fix that, I'd give them 5 stars !!

My husband was totally delighted with the Rollator Walker.  It is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone wouldn't want this new, much more attractive kind.  It folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things.  When folded up it fits in the back seat of our car, and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large.  We put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great, what more can you ask

I ordered this walker for my father a few months ago and am well-pleased.  It is much less expensive than comparable walkers.  The cushioned seat and basket are handy for long "trips" and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas.  A good buy for someone looking for a quality walker.  Even ships for free

  This product rocks , if you are serious about body building this is a must have ...I've been using NO-Explode about two weeks and seen some serious enhanchments.. First of my workout lasts at least an hour longer than usual and still have energy left over . Combine this product with the right amount of protein shake you are good to go...also note that this product does not cause any stomach cramping or aching like other creatine products do and tastes great

This product is ridiculous!!  Not in a bad way but ridiculous in the fact that my first time taking a serving I felt twice the energy, twice the bloodflow and three times as ready to hit the gym.

My first thoughts, "well maybe it's because my body isn't used to it yet".  Well, four tubs later I had dropped two pants sizes (32 to a 28), gained 15lbs in pure muscle and still have the exact same effects as I did the first serving!!

Not only that, I have passed this little known supplement on to friends and they have all said the same exact thing.  OMG!!  I only work out to stay in shape but with this product many people are telling me I look like I workout professionally

these wipes are great.  i have three children and have used the pampers, huggies, and house-brand wipes.  the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done. house-brand don't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough.  the pampers are thin, soft, and moist enough to get the job done-because they are thin, they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded / refolded for 100% useage (unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver).  definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said.  if you want something moister, go get a paper towel and wet it with water

The shampoo doesn't lather.  But it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day.  And it seems to be doing it's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch-free since I started using it.  So I would recommend it

I have three types of headlamps and I like this one the most.

Here is why: 1) it's cheap, 2) it runs a long time on three AAA batteries, and 3) the red light is awesome.

You can use the red light and still keep your "night vision". I use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or distracting to others as a white light.

My only problem with it is that the knobs are a little confusing, even after two years of use. I often have to twist twice to get the right setting. And I'm usually good at that stuff

I love the taste of these little Chocolates. I find that I need to have one 1 hour before eating - less and they don't work. If I have  two in one day (late morning, mid-afternoon) the effect is cumalative. I can eat a very light dinner and be completely satisfied

I use and like most all of the Olay lines of products.  This one is great because it is not only a sunscreen but a skin treatment as well.  I can't wait for the one that has a "hint of tan" in it along with the sunscreen to be on the market. I heard about it, but apparently it is not out as of yet.

I carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, and as a result get a lot of headaches.  I have been using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches.  I have not used it as a preventative - only when I already have a headache.  If something happened to the one I have, I would definitely buy another

After just 3 weeks of using this product my fasting blood sugar has dropped to 111.  Thats over 40 points!!!!  Pretty impressive.  My Dr. started me on Metformin but it made me very sick.  This stuff works much better wiht no side effects.  I wish I had known about this years ago as I have been fighting with high fasting sugars for years.  This product is a god send.

I found this product to be very unique, and helpful, in that I could quickly remove & retain the glasses around my neck.

Being far-sighted, I have come to need reading glasses, and these are perfect for my needs.  I can look 'down' through them, and look 'over the frame' for distance, all while they are secured around my head and neck.

I do hiking, using a GPS device, and these glasses allow me to look down at the GPS device in my hand, while also looking forward towards my path of travel.

Thank you for the innovative product

I found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutique.com.  The length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer.  I decided to try this product to see if it worked.  As hair growth is normally clocked at an 1/8 of an inch per month, I decided to monitor the results in my own little "clinical test."  This was actually pretty easy because I colour my hair so I'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month.

I ordered a box of Viviscal for which I paid $49 for (average price on the web) and the was set to take the first pill the following morning (the box recommends 2 per day).  I coloured my hair the night before so that in one month I'd be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring.

Results:

I didn't really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame.  I noticed my nails were growing very fast/very long.  I have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all.  It was very noticeable because I use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard.  Never having great nails, I was pretty happy to see this.  My curiosity was also getting the better of me as I could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2 weeks after coloring.  I took the tape measure and measured almost 1/4 of an inch in hair growth.  This would mean 1/2 inch per month and 6 inches per year.  I was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small, it was twice the rate my hair normally grows.  But I also noticed something else.  My hair was becoming unusually greasy.  Because I have very dry hair, I normally only wash it 2-3 times a week.  But every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal.  Hmmm.

Well, at the 1 month time frame I measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3/4 of an inch.  Not only that but I was constantly trimming my nails at this point.  I was totally ecstatic.  But also by this point, I was washing my hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle, it was much softer, but there was no way I could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy.

So - the conclusions I have reached from my test was this:

1.  Yes, Viviscal works.  It caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed.

2.  Viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster.

3.  Viviscal makes your hair greasy, causing you to have to wash it every day - and then it's fine.

It did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else, which I thought a bit strange (though good!!!).

I recommend this product

As a reviewer of the Hitachi Magic Wand, I can say that this Accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the job, the plus is that this can be used with or without the power cord. Perhaps just not as powerfull as the Hatachi but pretty dam comparable if not the same, the cordless battery operation is worth the trade off. As mentioned it does the job

While some of Larabars have a thick grainy-nut texture, this particular product is very smooth and almost tastes like chocolate candy. For those of us who can't eat real candy because of allergies, this one is a winner! It almost tastes like a soft Girl Scout thin mint cookie

Old Spice Classic is far and away the best deodorant I've ever used. It goes on clean, unlike those "powdery" white deodorants. It also has a great fragrance and longevity after application. I think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content; if you look at the ingredients, you'll see that alcohol is listed first. In fact, the container sports a "flammable" warning. The alcohol really does work well to contain odor. Alcohol-based deodorants are pretty hard to find, so I'm thankful this product is still being made

   Yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa, muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua. Le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae. Si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad.

This is the best shaver I've ever used.  It shaves closer and quicker than the many Norelcos I've used, all of which costed a lot more than the R-960.  The only improvement I'd like to see is in the battery, which does not really maintain its strength well between charges

This is a great shaver.  If you are in the market for one, considered the Remington R-960.  I am of Afro-American descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver.  I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug.  With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas.  I had considered purchasing that of another brand until I discovered that Remington makes one and now... I'm loving it

We needed something for our baby's room so that we wouldn't have to tip-toe around the house while she was napping. We ordered this item based on the great reviews, but didn't really know what to expect. It's much like the noise produced by a small fan, but without blowing air. It has two speeds, and complete control over the volume and pitch by adjustment of the louvers. Some reviews we read said it was not loud enough. I can't imagine that being a problem as we have it on the quietest setting (louvers completely closed, and low speed) and it's perfect. On high it's PLENTY loud for a device used while sleeping. This product did the trick for us, and I would recommend it to anybody with a light-sleeping baby

Recently got my SleepMate and it is very effective.  Somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom, and I don't have any trouble sleeping.  I use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night, and have the hardest time getting back to sleep.  I hardly ever wake up at all now.

Great product, and I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night's sleep

A friend of mine used to meet me for lunch while boasting a beautiful & glowing face from a $50.00 facial she had just received.  This product (even after the 1st use) produced the same results & I never had to leave my home.  My skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat.  My skin feels & looks like I've lost about 7 years time.  I'm very, very pleased with Olay.  I've used their Total Effects lotion for years & I did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit.  This is an excellent exfoliant & hands down, the best skin regenerating product I've ever used

After going back and forth between Oil of Olay and Neutrogena I settled on this product mostly because of the price (plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes.) I'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity. The orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes (I do it in the shower.) Of course, it's not microdermabrasian, but it is a great exfolliater for your skin

We used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently.  As a previous reviewer stated, sometimes it works, sometimes not, so I combined it with the recommended dosage for Infant Gas Drops and that would do the trick.  I found Little Tummy's brand at Babies-R-Us, which is less expensive and is the same thing.

Later, after 6 months and trying new foods, there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something didn't agree with her.  I gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she'd clearly feel better

Delivers moist heat. Great large size. You won't find anything larger anywhere.VERY relaxing as lavender is calming.
Only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes.
I have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min. and lied down with head & neck in comfortable position and it did a great job.
Pricey but worth it

  I found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings.  Keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results.  The size of the cuff is very important, so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results.  This is true in the doctors office also.  My blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office, on his machine, just by changing the size of the cuff.
   This is an excellent monitor - I couldn't be happier with it.  It is nice to be able to use it with batteries too.

I've used this for quite some time now and really like it.  I don't have the trouble with the toilet flushing that others seem to - but I suppose if you have one of those one-gallon regulated toilets, you'd probably have some trouble with this paper.  It is thicker and tons softer, but it does a wonderful job too on things like runny noses, running cat's eyes, cleaning the bathroom sink, mirror, you name it.  It's pretty strong stuff and I highly recommend it

I've been using Remington's Shaver Saver for 20 years. It keeps your shaver clean, lubricates well with not too much gooey oil, and works in an instant. I use a Remington MS2-100 Microscreen 2, and after a Shaver Saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer. A treatment seems to last for a while and I don't think it's necessary to use it every day. Usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new

I bought this to go with my MS2-200BPT Shaver. I saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well. I've been using it for about 1 month and I couldn't agree more. A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new. I can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since I've started using it. As a bonus, it seems to last quite a while. Another strong product from Remington

like the product very much. comfortable and convenient.  i would recommend then if: you have a small hat size, don't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag.  with the above i don't have a problem.  the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed, goggle like eye pieces on warm days.  i've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye, but have not done this as of jan,2007. i like them very innovative

Nearly two years of ownership and it has been a great purchase. I have no shame dorking up my drinking. Use to ensure legal driving or for ill advised contests. Also determine what at what BAC memory gets spotty (what point is there exceeding that?). Fun to call out big talkers who don't suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts. Also useful to get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive.

Pros
precision to third decimal place. rare at this price at time of my purchase

Very repeatable with consistant deep breath

Small enough to take to bars in jacket pocket or cargo pockets. Light for its size.

Cons
Innaccurate if sips have been taken within 10 minutes or so. True for all breathalyzers. Drunk idiots have tough time getting it through their heads

Warm up/calibration time ~45 sec. Another let down at parties but perhaps key to accuracy

Would be nice if it was more pocket sized

Chirps at you alarm clock style if above .08 "I know I'm drunk, shut up!

I purchase two of the Eva-dry EDV-500 renewable DeHumidifer and hang them inside the closet where I store my photo gears. Although in California is not so humid but little moisture do add up. This dehumidifer is so easy to use -- unwrap it then hang it there. I check them once per several day. When the silica gel change from blue to pick, I just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight, then next morning, wow, a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again. The changing of color is very obviously. I strongly recommend this item

I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  I highly recommend it

Optimum Nutrition's 100% whey protein is hands down the best I have tried, and I have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years. I used to be committed to EAS and Labrada, but I found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to ON Whey Protein.

I mix it with water, and sometimes soy milk. It mixes easy, doesn't taste gritty, and is pure protein. It goes down very easy and I have no trouble digesting it, plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan. Plus, the price is reasonable.

I am a former General Nutrition Center employee and there are hundreds of "powdered" protein products that "hype" about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out. if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick, bloated or passing gas, then you need to trust in Optimum Nutritions 100% Whey Protein. It truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes.
I strongly recommend 2% milk over water for even better taste, but water will still do the trick. If you buy Vanilla, i suggest mixing it with berries, bananas, strawberries, or bananas for added taste.
this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money

I have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout & for meal replacement to keep up protein intake. I read alot about mixing whey with coconut water & that is how I have been taking it (blended with a couple ice cubes). If you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take, I do & I actually look forward to the shake

If I could give this product over five stars, I would!  I get eczema on my eyelid and went through tons of products trying to find something to soothe it when I finally got this product in one of the starter kits Burt's Bees makes and I was hooked.  I use this with their marshmallow vanishing cream and my skin feels and looks great.  I have also noticed a decrease in the dark circles I always have when I use the royal jelly cream, though that could just be relief from no more eczema problems

I am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of Clics I own.
If you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect.
Their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on!  I'd
look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer.
Lastly ~ I've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use

I started using this several months ago after seeing it chosen as the best by Consumer's Report.  Within a few weeks, I could see measurable improvement in my skin.  Sure, not all the deep wrinkles went away, but enough of the smaller ones smoothed away so my 58-year-old skin looks younger.
My skin feels so much smoother and looks fresh.  I've had a lot of sun exposure from living in Australia, South Texas and Florida, so I'm thrilled to find a cream that does such a good job.  Lots cheaper too than many skin creams

My grandmother actually gave me a small sample of regenerist. I started to use it and fell in love with it. I have suffered with acne my entire life and I have found combining this along with my salicylic acid treatment my skin has improved drastically. I have since purchased a bottle of the regenerist serum that had a sample of regenerist night. These both seem to be making my skin clear up and be much smoother for applying cosmetics, which has been a problem due to my skin texture

I bought this item for my husband for Christmas.  He has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him.  We use these pillows everyday sitting up watching TV and he uses the head and knee wedges while he sleeps.  The only downfall now is that he sleeps so good he snores!

I am the kind of person that gets leg cramps or easily gets tired legs after a short walk, yet I need to work and that means that I have to be standing long hours. So when I tried your leg massagers I was ecstatic to find out the relief it gave me after a 10 minute use. I now use it every chance I get, my children use it after their soccer games and love it as well. It is one of the best purchases I have made.  It was worth the investment

This contains 16 servings, which means it will last you half a month.  That's pretty expensive when you break the price down by serving and whne compared with a 1 month supply of the flax capsules that costs $7.  However, liquid flax oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the store.
A flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg of flaxseed oil and a suggested dosage of 2-3 times a day.  So with pills you're getting 2-3g of flax oil a day.  With liquid flax oil, you're getting 14g of flax.

If you are buying this for it's purported treatment of acne, sunburn, diverticular disorders, hemorrhoids, and more serious health conerns, it's probably best to consume the liquid flax oil.  If you just want the benefits of lower cholesterol and heart disease prevention, a pill a few times a day, combined with fish oil should be all you need.

It's definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the morning than 3 flax pills a day, and when you loook at value, you're getting 224g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with a typical 100g in a 100 pill bottle of the capsules.  It all depends on what you need it for

Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties.

There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil:

Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis.

Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause.

Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure.

Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.

Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation.

Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's "bad cholesterol") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil.

Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer.

Nature Made Flaxseed Oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil.

The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal.

The benefits of Flaxseed Oil are cumulative.  Commit to taking it every day without fail.  Like any herbal supplement, don't expect dramatic quick results.  The results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time.  For specific conditions such as Rhematoid arthritis, exzema, psoriasis, acne, etc,. the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks.  Be patient!  Know that even if you don't "feel" different, you are sill protecting your body from the harmfull effects of many disease conditions.

Loving this Air Purifier! This was really the first one I have own so I can't compare it to any others. It is very quite, and takes alot of dust out of the air. The first time I had to replace the filter I was shocked by how much dust I could of been breathing in. Worth picking up, just wish it would of had an energy star label.

My youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis.  I bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust, mold, pollen, ect.  She has been using this product for three (3) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time.  We have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product.  Highly recommeded

Back in the early 90s I was going through a bad acne period.  I finally visited a dermatologist, and he put me on an Accutane regimen.  I had sensitive skin and a tough beard, so regular shaving cream was too harsh (especially while taking Accutane - the solid brush-on cream I was using at the time burned the edges of my lips).  He recommended that I shave with Cetaphil.  Years later, my skin and beard are still troublesome.  Therefore, I've kept Cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen.

Cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver.  It's not harsh or irritating, even on a freshly shaved face.  However, it's kind of cold in the morning, which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers.  So I put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff.  By the time I'm done, it's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two.

However, even though Cetaphil feels good and lubricates well, its consistency is a bit thin to use alone.  I like a good lather, so I combine Cetaphil with Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, which was recommended to me by a woman working at GNC.  They mix well together, and I get a good, non-irritating shave by using the Gillette Fusion Power razor.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I apply a product that contains salicylic acid, such as Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.

If you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me, then make Cetaphil part of your shaving routine.  Recommended

I have been using this for my face for over 10 years.  It is very inexpensive (especially compared to other cosmetic brands) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin.  I also used it on my 3 kids.  It comes in handy on the changing table, especially when the wipes were not quite "wet" enough to do the job!  It is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing.  It can just be wiped off without leaving any residue.  It is very gentle, even for newborn's skin

I'm a black male and everytime I would shave normally I would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs. At first i'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day I'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads (about 10-20 of them). That was  before. Now after I apply the product I don't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore. It just feels like I never had any hair on my face in the first place. The only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but I don't really care I mean it's not like the product claims to be painless.

I installed this unit in my basement about 6 months ago, and it has been working flawlessly ever since.

Things I noticed:

If the power goes out, the unit will NOT turn back on automatically (as some other units do.)

If you want to use the continuous drainage (which I highly recommend) via a hose, you have to punch out a plastic disc on the side of the unit. I would have designed a screw-type plug that was replacable, but they didn't think of that. Anyway, once you punch the quarter-size disc out it's out forever.

If you choose to use the continuous drainage feature, you will need to pick up a hose with an inner diameter of 15mm (.59" or just over half an inch.) I went to the local DIY center and found some clear tubing that has worked well.

The unit can operate down to 2-degrees C (36-degrees F), which will be great for continuous operation in the garage to keep the tools from rusting.

Has three fan settings: med, high and quiet. "Quiet" really is quiet, and could probably work just fine in a bedroom. Though, it does warm the room it's in. How much it warms it depends on the humidity setting.

Four settings: The humidty level (humidstat) can be set to "continuous dehumidification" (which is the default setting), 50%, 60% and 70%. The fan will continue to run but the dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the selected humidity level. Cool. I mean, that's when the fan will just blow room-temp air.

A full drainage tank will stop the unit and illuminate a "tank full" indicator light.

The unit is not that heavy -- maybe for some, but not nearly as heavy as some people make it sound. It's 30.8 pounds.

According to the instructions: You will need at least 21 cm (about 8 inches) of clearance in front, behind and side to side. Air blows out of the top of the unit, so you'll need to make sure it's clear as well.

There are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight up, 45-degrees or almost straight ahead.

Power consumption: CFM-25E is 220W // CFM-40E is 330W

I highly recommend this model dehumidifier

I've used this razor for about 2 yrs.  For me and my wife, it gives me a great close shave.  I've never had a problem with skin irritation.  Just how hard are these other guys pressing the razor on their face?!  I can't imagine.  I only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave.  The shave is fast, about 2 mins.  The dual blade design (each of the three heads has two rows of blades!) is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast.  I'll probably stick with Remington rotories from now on, but will upgrade to a corded/cordless.

My problems with it are:

Can't use with cord if the battery dies (didn't know this when I bought it)
The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.

Otherwise, it's a great solid razor

I have used Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream for over a year now. It leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely. It does not have spf protection so for daytime I use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation. At night it's all you need

I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and I thought they'd improve upon the Mach3.  Well they did!  This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don't know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Haha...

He's very happy with it and likes the shave.  And speaking about money, if the shave and blades last longer than before, it's a great value!

Highly suggested!!

Purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend who uses this product, he was excited to receive this.  I was excited that I was able to purchase it at a considerable savings over department store prices.  This same product in a smaller size retails for $45-$55 locally and I was able to purchase him a larger bottle for less than $30.  This particular item by Davidoff is not always easy to find and I was glad to not only find it here but to find it at such a reasonable price

This product is great for injury and leg elevation.  My grandmother had a hematoma on her leg and she said that her "legs don't fall asleep anymore and they feel so good."  My grandmother has had two strokes and this is just the relief that she needs.  My mother has fibromayalgia and I'm ordering two for her as well.  She "test-drove" them before giving a set to my grandmother and this will be a great holiday gift for her

I am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because I constantly burn.  I have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied.  I went on my honeymoon to the Maldives in November and was able to stay out in the sun, go swimming and I did not have to constantly reapply.  I didn't get burned once!  Bull Frog Superblock is the best sunblock around

Have used this product on myself for many years when particapating in ultra endurance cycling events, as well as on my family when vacationing in tropical area's where the sun will cook you quickly without adequate sun protection. Do not be fooled by thinking you will not get tanned by using  SPF 45 or better. That is a misconception...why not walk away from your experience in the sun without the discomfort of sun poisoning. Found best result's when put on indoors prior to being in the sun.

The chair has simple pre-set programs (I basically use only the full-body massage), but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area.

Of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the $2,500 chairs, but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value

I am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university.  As such, I am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general.  I really like Neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality.  For most people, I think it offers great protection, but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer.

According to my dermatologist, recent studies have shown that SPF 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and doesn't offer adequate protection after that time.  This is partly due to most people not using enough.  In other words, they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection.

For this reason, Neutrogena SPF 45 or 55 is better.  Also, the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer products have been updated to include a technology called Helioplex.  Most dermatologists that I know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important.

I have used both this product and the higher SPF Helioplex formulations.  In practice, I have found BOTH adequate for my needs.  What I particularly like is that you don't even know you have the product on.  It has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you can't even notice it.  Both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use, but my understanding is that the Helioplex formulation is even better.  Further, it feels exactly the same on the skin.  The only drawback is it's a bit more expensive.

This is also a good product because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  Both are implicated in skin cancer and it's important to protect yourself against both.  If you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one.  However, if you want the very best protection try the Neutrogena Helioplex SPF 55.  This will give you the most peace of mind

My daughter and I have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like, and never found one that was completely satisfactory. She has oily skin prone to breakouts, and mine is combination. Every one we tried always left a greasy feel and look to the face, even the ones that were supposed to be oil-free.
Finally, I came across a review of this product on Paula Begoun's website (www.cosmeticscop.com). The review sounded good, so I went out and bought some right away. My daughter and I both LOVE this product! It's the only sunscreen we have ever used that doesn't leave a greasy feel or look to the skin. It dries to a matte finish, and works very, very well under foundation, too. Without foundation, there is no need to use powder to kill the shine. And it feels so light on the skin, you barely know it's there!
  If you have oily or combination skin and have never found a sunscreen that doesn't look and feel greasy, try this one! It's the best!

I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them.

Where this product really shines (or DOESN'T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it's so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that's already your natural moisturizers).

I have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it, I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want).

This magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too! It's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there's a nice matte feel.

HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3 hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature.

Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin.

BTW, this review is for the actual product I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review, here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper, too! I don't know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or wrongly, I don't know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the strength of the ingredients, so maybe it's better for sensitive skin (?)

Using this product, her calves become soft and getting thin.

this is a wonderfull massager, i have had other ones in the past and they were'nt as good as this one. for $50 this massager is great it really was well worth the money for what it gives out to yourself. the power on it was amazing i was really shocked i dident think it would be that much in a good way though. so i was very pleased with buying this acuvibe massager and it really does work great so i hope i helped you make your chose right

i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator, well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way. it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it. it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good. and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so.

Shavers fall into two categories, those who prefer rotaries like the Norelco and those who prefer foil shavers.

For those of you who like foil shavers, this is the one for you!

I've owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent, while it lasted... The charger kept breaking on me (once in the first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later [3/2007]). It was expensive, and the refills were a pain, pricey, but they worked.

After two exchanges I decided to try the norelco 8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close, they tore up my neck. The problem only got worse. Returned 3 weeks later.

I just got the Panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors. They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos.

I'm not sure if I like the "side to side" pivoting head, only time will tell. The heads don't pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary.

One MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water... No expensive refills to hassle over.

The panasonic has two noticeable downsides:

1. It's louder than other shavers, but who cares? It shaves incredibly fast anyway.

2. You can't plug it in and shave... You have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on.



This is my favorite razor by far.

I have to say that I have been converted. For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type of razor, but now I find it's not the best shave. I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn't shave often. (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had. The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow. My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different and when I told him, he went out and bought one too, he also loves it now. My fiancé said she would leave me if I stopped using the Panasonic, it's a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles. The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it, I have charged it twice but it really didn't need it as it said the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don't think it can get any better. This product does not include the cleaning base. I do recommend it as even if you don't use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying. But, if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor, this is it!

I am a woman of color and this product eliminates any discoloration without irritation or disturbing my combination skin. I highly recommend this product for women who need to brighten their appearance once a week.

After 5 years I continue to use this and the pumpkin exfoliating mask. The papaya is good as well

This is the 2nd year that I have used the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 45.  I have Normal to Oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I am fair and can burn easily.

I think this product is well worth the money, it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel.  It does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out.  I apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours.  The time will vary depending on your sun tolerance, though.  It is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile

I got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress.  It was pretty pungent, but it felt so good the first time I layed in it.  after a couple days it appeared to lose it's memory and start to dent and crease, but eventually it got back to full expansion.  The customer service with this item was fantastic!

We'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory

When I get a sinus infection, it stays and builds much congestion. Rx and over-the-counter has limited value. One event that led to my first (I am 69) severe asthma event, which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury.

NeilMed pre-mixed packets sound like the "minor leagues" compared to the above. When a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus areas hostile to infection, these little packets take the mess out of measuring your own salt and soda(i.e. to make a mistake is painful even with the right salt).

Then there is a $15 price in local stores for 100 packets, or about the same on-line for 200. Also a quick response from the vendor.

Bought 2 of these 3 years ago on QVC for my husband and myself.  I was pregnant with my second son and going to get waxed at the nail shop, where it smelled like nail polish remover, was just too much for me at the time.  We love these shavers and they work just as well today as they did 3 years ago!  I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, I get an incredibly close shave with this.  To be honest, and maybe a little too personal, I haven't waxed my upper lip since, I only use this!  There is NO stubble, NO pain and great results!  I have dark hair, and if this in anyway made me look like I shaved, I would never use it!  I am buying 2 more for back up.  I hope they never stop making these!!

I've tried a lot of different "nutrition" and "energy" bars, and these are my favorites (along with a couple of other chocolate ZonePerfect bars like Double Chocolate and Chocolate Raspberry). Great taste, a nice texture (sort of like Nestle Crunch), and much more satisfying than candy bars.  Almost as tasty as Girl Scout "Thin Mints", but not as fat- and guilt-inducing

My 16-year-old daughter used this on problem acne on her back and shoulders with noticeable results by the second day - existing blemishes healed, no new break-out.  She's excited.  No harsh benzoyl peroxide (active ingredient is salicylic acid).    The Body Scrub has the little exfoliating "beads" in it (not mentioned on the bottle) - so it makes skin feel smooth immediately.  And the fragrance is very light, clean (gender-neutral).
Also, it's very concentrated, so it goes a long way - making it easily worth the money as far as any body wash goes (and Amazon's price is better than the in-store price).
Of course, everyone is different when it comes to acne treatments - but it worked here.

This give an excellent finish to a shave.  I strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well.  Apply hot water to dilate your pores, then apply the oil, then shaving cream, shave, and finally the after shave balm.  The oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience.  Your face feels incredibly smooth afterward.  I don't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone, but I do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after

I knew a man who once wore this classic cologne, and always smelled so good.  I bought it for my hubby this Christmas and instantly remembered why I loved that smell so much.  It is a classic frangrance, not stinky or overpowering - but fresh.  There are other Vetiver cologne's out there, but they smell NOTHING like the Guerlain from France. It's a gorgeous smell, and I guarantee you would love it if you are looking to smell great without it being overpowering. It's smooth and mellow, fresh

I say the scale is pretty good and accurate but the Fat % keep changing different % in the morning and night, Like in the morning I got 30.2% and at Night it say I got 25.8%. I dont really trust the Fat % but The Pound Is very Accurate.
For the Price I would rather get something cheaper

The Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Creme was a dream for this mother. My 7-year-old was unfortunate enough to inherit a severe callous problem that affects his hands and feet. The problem is so severe in his father that his father's hands and feet are literally split open and very painful. The 7-year-old has already started with very hard calluses and nothing seems to relieve them. Nothing, that is, until now. Just a small nightly dose seems to be helping immensely into giving my dear son back the soft feet I would expect a 7-year-old to have. I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry, cracked feet

You couldn't have picked a better person to Test Drive this product. I have severely dried and callused heals. From the moment I put the creme on my feet, they felt smoother. The creme stays on for hours like the product says. I can't believe the difference it's made in such a short time. I'll definitely buy this product, and I'll be recommending it to my mom, whose feet are drier than mine are

This is the best investment ever! They start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin. It was so easy to set up & start enjoying. I've used it on average twice a week and my feet & hands are so wonderfully moist--even in this winter weather. My heels are no longer cracked & my cuticles are so healthy--not snagging at all. Thank you for this perfect product & so much cheaper than going to the salon! It's so relaxing (I use lavender) as I do this just before bed

I have been having severe back pain (muscular)and subsequent headaches on a daily basis for many months.  I finally brokedown and went to see one of my colleagues who is a physiatrist.  He recommended the theracane to me.  He is a physician who is both a DC, (Doctor of Chiropractic) and a physician, DO. This physician has been doing trigger point therapy including intramuscular needling to help release the painful knots in my back. I find that I can use the theracane in between visits with noted relief.  This same doctor states that this condition is like diabetes and needs to be managed for life and thus, the theracane allows for me to maintain.  I think the theracane is an ingenious invention.  I don't really have anything negative to say, with the exception of the pain I am trying to manage.  The product arrived quickly after I ordered it and it is exactly as described.

The Theracane is a fantastic tool for unknotting hard-to-reach muscles.  It looks clunky, but the shape is right for providing leverage (and therefore more pressure) to just the right spots.

A great companion for the Theracane is "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, 2nd edition" by Clair Davies.  It matches sore places on the human body with the trigger points (the muscle knots) that cause them.  I solved a persistent recurring pain in my upper back by massaging a trigger point near my throat.

The Unwind company is an A+ operation.  Ordering is easy, customer service is friendly, their prices are among the lowest, and shipping is super-speedy (my order shipped within two hours).  I ordered directly from their website and received free shipping.

We all have from time to time brought those heavy bottle of liquid detergent to the washing machine, and breaking our backs in the process. Thankfully, All Small & Mighty might be a unique solution. It is a concentrated detergent that works with the capacity of a traditional 100 ounce bottle. I like it because it really does a great job at cleaning clothes that haven't been completely spotless from all those tough messes from other methods. I really think that everyone should own this product because it saves a lot of headaches, while being true to its price. That's All!

Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break.

Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face.
The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face

After 3 months use, I'm buying two more of these for my daughters. The unit is compact, very sturdy, virtually silent, and puts out plenty of mist even on the low setting. The small tank is light and easy to fill, even in a bathroom sink (many people really have to wrestle with those one gallon tanks) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or nights sleep.

The key feature is that it is small and quiet. That means it can be near you on a desk top or night table. Having the mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will condense on cold windows (and cause mildew). It also means you can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top. If you want to use the high setting, put the unit on top of a book shelf, dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the mist to settle.

This is small and light enough to take on the road to dry hotel rooms. One daughter wants one for her dorm room, which is overheated. The unit is easily moved from bedroom to den or wherever you locate during the day. You would not find this convenient with large (gallon) humidifiers.

This unit is also inexpensive, at around $30 which is half the cost of many larger models (so you can get two). After using several evaporative humidifiers, I love not spending $6 - $9 a month for paper replacement wicks.

Overall, I am delighted with the unit. The only criticsm is the blue LED is too bright in a dark room. This is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive tape over it. The light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night. It also lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the chamber.

Highly recommended.

You know right away your teeth feel different, much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning.

The dual action (larger) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly isn't as aggressive as the smaller one in it's ability to clean. If you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job. The flossing attachment was also very effective

After brushing with the HydraBrush, my teeth feel as clean as when I've been to the dental hygenist.
This is a great product.  I am so glad that replacement brushes are available at Amazon

Hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushHead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards. I use the soft brushHead because I used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen, but since using the Hydrabrush and the 8 brushes (4 on each side) I don't have to worry about missing when I brush my teeth. Excellent product.

I used this to get marks off my washer and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house!  This little "sponge" is awesome, and it is just like a sponge; it's not abrasive.  The only problem I see with it (and all cleaning products) is that you actually have to use it for it to work; lol

For anyone on the fence about these, jump over to my side ;) My (then) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my husband's permanent black marker.
We just bought a brand new refrigerator. I turned my back for a few moments, and when I looked back, she had scribbled *all over* my new fridge.
I tried bleach, soap, scrubby sponges... nothing worked. My first new appliance was ruined!
On a whim I bought this. (Couldn't hurt, right?)
It got it off immediately! (I had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves.) I was so excited, I started running around my house trying to find things to scrub...
I know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease, markers or crayons from walls, and a multitude of other "sins" your children may commit against your home.

My kids love this game.  They sit down together and play this game all of the time.  The neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and SORRY is the one they choose the most.  We do not have video games at our house, and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games.  Now they come over all of the time just to play board games.  I say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games.

Sorry is top game in our house

I bought this kitchen for my 18 mos. old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it.  It is a nice, compact size that doesn't take up too much space.  She can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated.  Another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box.  My only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open, but I know as she gets older, it will become easier.  I would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child

My kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with Renaissance paintings. They've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them. I realize this is not the typical situation.

I was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck. It is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid's knowledge. I had hoped for a game like "Famous Authors" which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players.

Nonetheless, the game is well presented. It's on the expensive side, but the book alone is worth half the price. Looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones? I recommend this

My 16 month old loves her new groceries.  The produce &amp;amp; sandwich parts are plastic &amp;amp; each piece has a wonderful texture. The canned goods are very interesting to read.  They are actually labeled by a supermarket in the UK, so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the US.  I put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older. She has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate.  This was a great purchase.

This toy looks very appealing. I purchased this for my son, 16 months at the time thinking it would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could play while I cooked cleaned etc. He played with it about 4 times total and he's 2 now! It doesn't do enough and does have much other than a shape sorter. I consider it wasted money but if my experience helps anyone I'm glad

Wonderful product. We bought this as a gift for my son's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice.  He loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler, so a real book was a huge hit.  He thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures.  His book will be a cherished keepsake and I'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown

I can't say enough about Illustory!  My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet.  So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say.  We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book!  The quality was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the author" page with her picture (which I provided).  We even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her!  I highly reccomend this kit

An unexciting piece. Of value only to the completist collector (like myself). There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing "great" about it either. The lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a "holographic" figure. Hasbro could has done better by choosing another "host" sculpt to base this exclusive off of. The "Phantom Menace" version was much better

I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters.  There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining.
 I really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too.  Once they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary.  I was a little nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it.  In my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and I would definately recommend it

Just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short

This is really fun for adults.  We get together once a month and we really enjoy the company, the food and the spirits.  This was meant for adults to solicize not for children.  I am sure they might learn somehting at another gathering.  I have really enjoyed Bunco.

We have enthusiastically played Candy Land with each of our three kids.  It is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games.  Players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board.  The cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red, green, yellow, etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color.  No counting or reading is required.  There are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind, and they are indicated by  picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece.  Play continues until one player reaches the end.

Some of my observations:

1) Most kids can probably start playing and enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age.  If you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit down for a 10-15 minute game, I'm pretty confident they could enjoy it.

2) Among the lessons our kids learned from CandyLand: taking turns, recognizing colors, and dealing with disappointment.   Luckily, the games are quick enough that it is usually possible to play multiple games in one seting.  This makes it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one win.  (Very helpful for managing little egos)

3) For such a simple game, it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary.  The game is literally in doubt until the last card is played (one of the "special" cards might send a player back to near the start).  This is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons: "NEVER give up".

4) With most simple games, it is almost impossible to get older kids to play after they reach a certin age.  We have not found that to be as true with Candy Land.  We've had games with an adult and kids ages 3, 6, and 9 playing together and having fun.  If you have more than one kid, you know how hard this can be.

As a parent of three, I give this game my highest recommendation

This game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it

     I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch!  That is until I played it at my friends house!  Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions!  This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time!  I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older

This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute

This little motorcycle is cute.  However, it's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer.  The stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date, none have peeled off.  The extreme shipping price added another $10 to the $19.99 price tag.  This is definately not a $30 toy.

I-Dog is so fun to use!  All you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's headphone port and I-Dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker.  I-Dog's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play.  His tail serves as a mute button, but be careful because he doesn't like you touching too often!  I-Dog will get sad if you don't give him any music to listen to.  If you don't have a digital player, you can set I-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can "hear" that way.  There are only two reasons why I didn't give I-Dog 5 stars:  (1) The internal speaker isn't very loud, so you have to have your music player turned up quite high, and (2) the battery cover on I-Dog's back leg is really hard to get off.  You will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off

My 3 year old is very interested in space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets the need for a realistic shuttle, though

This is a must have for your little sweetheart! My daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes. It's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ;)The accessories are cute, but she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received this on Christmas and has been a favorite since.

Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old.  He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game. Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I paid at Target on sale for sure.

Just wanted to let others know this info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ...

I called Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it.  You can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the website.  The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto).  The stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really can't give my opinion.

Hope that helps someone

I bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint.  He absolutely loved this set.  The colors are wonderful and the different types of pens, paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him.  The case is sturdy and great so he doesn't lose anything.  The price can't be better for everything you get.

I am so glad I bought this puzzle for my 3 year old! The pieces have the most beautiful pictures on them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler hands. This is one of those toys that you'll want to keep forever

It is really expensive for what it is.  I have to say my children love it, esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it.  I love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf.  However, for the supplies you get it IS expensive.  The tote itself is nice but not worth more than $5, add the supplies to it, maybe I could see spending $10.  However, if you catch it on sale I would pick up a few, they make great gifts

I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. SHE LOVED IT IN THE STORE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STICKERS, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GENIOUS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO. I CHOSE TO NOT SHAROEN THE PENCIL BECAUSE SHE IS 3 AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY. FOR TWENTY DOLLARS IT IS A GOOD BUY. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND IS HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH IT

Very interesting spoof of the original game.  I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays.  It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it

     I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch!  That is until I played it at my friends house!  Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions!  This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time!  I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older

Every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime. The characters on the game board are so awesome too. Queen Frosting (that was her name... right?) is so pretty, she was always my favorite character. All in all, it's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child

I agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with it

This was a great buy from Amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping.  My [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of Melissa and Doug products.  We normally purchase them from Tuesday Morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper.

This puzzle has made my toddler happy.  He fits it together then dumps it, repeating the process several times a day.  The drawing is realistic and there are no pegs, so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece.

My 9 year old son just started to understand this game, we bought it when he was 7.  He would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships.  He would say where his ships were.  This game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are.  It depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game.

I thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first.  This was the first toy she opened at Christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week!  She enjoyed collecting the fingers and and "counting" them.  She also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet. Very durable, love that it is a traditional wood toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! She still loves it months later.  The only downside to any toy like this, is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house.

My 28 month old son got this puzzle for Christmas and loves it.  He put it together the first time out of the box himself. It is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day.  My almost 5 year old likes it too. It is not as sturdy as the Melissa & Doug floor puzzles, but it still really sturdy.

We got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter's friends.  It was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts, and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she could have one, too.  The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present

Bertie is nice.  He has no magnetic pieces so he won't hook to other things.  Nice 16month old tries to use him on the train track which does work but he wasn't really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track

My two year old has several of these cars, and the race track. He loves all things Cars, so these were a big hit. All of the Shake and Go Cars talk before they run, which he especially likes. They are VERY easy for a toddler to operate, but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them, too. They don't run for very long per shake, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all

This board is of excellent quality and is highly transportable, but a little small for Go players who play avidly. The stones are also small, but they get the job done. Why I bought this board was because I wanted to be able to take it with me, without a huge board dragging me down. This fits what I want almost perfectly. Thanks

When my 25 year old daughter sat down to play Wedgits with her younger siblings, she declared that she wanted a set for Christmas.  She thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends.  My friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son-in- law monopolize them with their little competitions.  These are wonderful for the imagination, and with Wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy

This was the best therapy game ever.  My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games.  We mostly played it with their friends.   I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me.  I decided to bring it to a family gathering.  I have always been distant with my eight siblings.  The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect.  then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played.  We had a total awakening of how we see each other.  We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful.  This game is the best.  We laughed so hard we ached the next day.  We played till 2:00 a.m.  Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home.  We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL  I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together

My cousin loves these dolls. She loves that she gets to be a "little mommy" to a boy AND girl...that's what i love about this set...plus the dolls are adorable and the only thing I don't like about them is the hats. I wish the hats were...cuter? I don't know but it doesn't matter. I'd buy these dolls for any really little girl. She used to cry when she lost accessories for her other dolls...but at least with these there isn't much to lose

It seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. There are few "Barbie" Jeeps, few polaris ATVs, one Corvette and three Gators and few others. My 4 year old daughter was the first Gator owner.

I must say, it is expensive.. This thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has, bar none. Should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy? Well... that's up to you.

But she loves her gator. She had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one, but she is extremely happy with it. Sometimes I wish I was 40lbs so I can ride this thing. She can't care less about the "barbie" thing, so this green utility machine was fine with her.

The gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the Barbie jeep. The truck bed is really useful. Although not recommended, she hauled two kids on the bed. With 4 kids on the car, it still zoomed around the street quite well. One time I loaded nail gun, air compressor, electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence. I saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs. It made such a funnt scene.. little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff. Very cute.

Enough of fun stuff.

Problem 1. Battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing. You have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger. It hurts.

Problem 2. The left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it. I tightened it again and never happened.

Problem 3. Slipping tires. People complain about the tires having very low friction. They slip very easily on driveway and grass. But this is how it "protects" its gearbox so I don't really care, but I heard they are expensive once they wear out.

I think this is the best ride-on toy on the market today. If extra $[...] won't hurt you too much, then do consider the gator. Your children will not be disappointed.

We got this toy for my son when he was 2 1/2 years old he is now 4 years old. It still runs like new. He drives it like a champ. We have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks. It never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is. I am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now.

I ought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday.  She loves the bead maze at the top and she goes round and round the cube exploring all the different sides!

So as the title would suggest, the stickers on the cog wheels are starting to come off (after 1 week).  This doesnt affect the functionality of the toy, just the aesthetics.  If you are not bothered by some bare cogwheels this is still a great toy!

It stands 2 feet tall to the top of the maze and is the perfect height for little ones.  The other 3 sides are: ABC with pictures rotating blocks, Abacus, Sliding plastic pegs.  The only side with stickers is the cog wheels so no worries about other sides losing stickers.

If they had made the cog wheels out of wood or had the design painted or imprinted into the plastic this toy would be a 10

My son, who is 3, loves dinosaurs and everything green.  This toy was perfect.  The dinosaur comes in Green and Red. I bought green for my son and gave the red one to his cousin.  They have dino wars.  This dinosaur moves, roars, and flashes its eyes red, which looks really cool in the dark.  My son flys it around the room & uses it to attack other toys.  This proved to be a such agreat toy, I bought another (#2) green dino to have my son and husband have dino fights.  This toy is the best I have found.

This toy was bought for my son (14 months) because he has an obsession with the phone.  My son instantly LOVED this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and I'm on it.

It is a great travel toy as well.  Being in the armed forces, we are constantly on the move and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing with his phone.

Sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it's a small price to pay for your kids true happiness.  My one gripe with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it, he broke the center button that flips the features.  We returned it to the store and have not been able to find it except online.  I'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again

My son got this for his 5th birthday and he loves it! He likes to turn off the lights and give "shows" for the family. We have not listened to the Cds yet but I am sure they are a great add-on. My son is fascinated by space adn this porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more. I don't know if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have no complaints. In fact, we are going to purchase some of the other packs available

This game set it of amazing quality. Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand.

This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot.

Anyways, if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful. But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this

The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses).  The recurring image of the forest in German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time.  Therefore, what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction.

In the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister.  The Brothers Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane Doe).  Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl."

All that background makes it rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries."  This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar around her neck, and torn fish net stockings.  There are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage, Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood.  She also has a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the Grimms tale).

Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a twisted sense of humor.  With these figures McFarlane Toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level.  Even if you do not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you

The wagon is great, as expected.  5 stars for the wagon, no stars for delivery.

It arrived with a dent, though, and when we called they told us a replacement wouldn't be available until mid-February, plus we'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing, which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot, and the recipients probably won't care, but it was a pain-in-the-butt, and there didn't seem any way to deal with it that wouldn't have been too much trouble.

I got a wagon like this when i was really small. Now I am 14 and Istill use it for getting grocries from the store.  It is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends  ride in it.   It is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home.   It can go really fast and it's easy to steer.   You have to be careful if  you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it.  One time my mom was  pulling me and my sister to the store.  When she went over the curb it  tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. It is a great toy  and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot

I had a Radio Flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it,  which is why I wanted one for my daughter.  We bought ours when our daughter was a year old, and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it. Now  that she's four, she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother around,  or posing for pictures with him in it. We use it for picnicing in the local  park, or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn. The  wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos, from the Labor Day  block party to Halloween trick-or-treating. It's a &quot;classic&quot; for  good reason--kids love it, and never stop loving it

My son received this as a christmas gift, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is not a regular DVD. It is designed to go with the "Read With Me DVD" system (a separate remote control that works with it on your TV). A previous reviewer was not aware of this, so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error

 My 2 year old grandson loves balls of any kind,when I found this activity set I knew he would really enjoy it,he plays with it for hours. The only downside of this is that he cannot keep up with the balls. It would be great if this company would give parents,or grandparents an order form to get replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life

I bought this for my son's second Christmas; he was almost 2.  It was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and I had to hunt it down 3 years ago. He loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole!  He still plays with it and I will be buying his baby brother one when he's big enough

My 5 year old twins really like this game...it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings, but that is why they like it so much.  On the other hand, my 3 year old finds it very frustrating. If you are considering purchasing this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a piece of sand paper to help with the slippage.

My eight and nine year old sons are big Lego fans. I bought one set for each of my boys and they each built a different model. Both models came out great. The parts fit together beautifully and the finished product moves very well when played with. The vehicles are even better than they look in the pictures on the box. This was the first Technic set that they tried. I hope they enjoy future Technic sets as much

My 23-month old son received this toy for Christmas and it was one of his favorites. He played with it off and on for hours. Woke up this morning and ran right to it. It isn't very educational but the fact that he recognizes the songs from the show makes it more fun. It's not too bulky so it's something we can take in the car. Overall, we love it and would recommend it to any Wiggles fan ;-

I have wanted to buy a Musini for my son for a few years now, but never found one in a retail store, online or local. I recently gave in and bought one gently used on eBay for a fantastic price including the cartridge. My entire family LOVES it, including my 2-year-old son. It was very easy to figure out how to use, even without a manual. On the battery case are very clear, easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your Musini. Within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing. Even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the Musini! My dad couldn't keep his feet still, insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute. I have found myself taking it out during my son's nap time to put near me while I do the mundane chores around the house. It is really addicting and keeps us all moving!

I can't say enough good things about this toy. The music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to. You also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers. The songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize. I have also noticed that you can use the Musini to up your child's physical activity. If you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard, you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise! You can, of course, adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register. It's up to you, and I think it's fantastic! Highly recommended

We had a simpler and earlier Quercetti marble run.  This was an upgrade/add-on, and well worth it.  The motorized elevator keeps the action going.  A five year old will need help setting up, but can operate the final run easily.  Safe pieces, easy construction and good directions.  Fun, even for the adults

Gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday.  I helped him to construct it from the clear (no reading) directions along with my 10-year old daughter.  The pieces go together flawlessly - the engineering of the plastic is superb.  The elevator works as designed and the battery pack (2xAA) connects via a short cord - very convenient.  He has already spent many hours playing with it

Our three children, who are now in their forties, were young when we purchased a Bozo Bop Bag for them.  They loved it, used it all the time, and it held up beautifully through the years.   Now our daughter has a daughter of her own and we purchased one for her.  Same design, same wonderful quality, same use as forty years ago.  Bozo is a "friend" who likes to be punched so he can bounce back up.  Our 3 year old grand daughter loves him.  She now has a baby sister 7 months old who will also be able to make use of Bozo.  For toddler activity and appropriate "acting out", I thoroughly recommend this product with no reservation.  It's a bit pricey, but worth 5 stars for sure

Its the best table out there. I did a lot of research and now have a year of "testing." We bought it for my daughter when she was 1, and she's almost 3. I also run a daycare. The chairs don't tip and various ages from 2-5 have put them to their worst. It cleans easily and is easy to put aside, if needed. I did have to replace a chair once (I stood on it.) and the customer service was fast and friendly.

We did not buy the refill but purchased the original set with sandbox. It works wonderfully and my kids have played with it for hours. Clean up is easy. Another family I know just used theirs for the 1st time and they also had a wonderful experience.

This large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the "classic collection".  Children of all ages (and adults) can build ships, planes, houses -- whatever the mind imagines -- in a variety of colors.  The bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage.

While Lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products, for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character, this is a great product

This figure of the great Wayne Gretzky is a must-have for those who collect hockey memorabilia.

The figurine is life-like, with Gretzky's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal.

What I love most about this toy is that you can purchase Gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned. If you are like me and collect Gretzky memorabilia (pictures, cards, jerseys, etc), this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection.

Since I had always wanted a "mad scientist" lab when I was a girl and never got one, my husband purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and I to do together.  Overall, it's been fun.  Everything but water has been included which is a plus.  The "lab" comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways.  I like this component because it helps children with problem solving, creativity and motor skills.  The kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker.  It's really taught my son to learn how to measure.  However, the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards, which my son would not be able to figure out without my help.  The steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch.  On the other hand, the "experiments" or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments.  They also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors, flavors.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the "experiments" actually tasted for a toy kit.  On the other hand, if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the "recipie" cards.  Overall, this was a great gift because it got my son and I to spend some fun time together

I found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins don't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys. However the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit. The hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he can't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to. Good Ite

I looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox, seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person. I took a chance on this one because the price was right, and I'm very pleased. I like the pockets on the front, my son loves putting his books in & out. If I would change one thing it is the lid. It is lightweight as to not hurt little hands & fingers (which is good), but is never locked onto the toybox, it lifts off very easily, so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in. Other than that we love it

We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one.  We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside.  It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric.  We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there.  We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.  Highly recommend!

I have been wanted a non-electronic non-paper Sudoku game for some time.  Rubik's Sudoku is a self contained single player game board.  I can move it from room to room without the playing pieces moving from where I have placed them on the board.  There is one extra piece for each number/color tile included.  With the color coding it is easy to learn the strategy behind Sudoku.  I was not picking it up very fast when I tried the paper versions.  After I progress through the 100 puzzles included with this game I'll use the game board and pieces with the Sudoku magazine I have.  For the cost I would recommend this over the more expensive wood versions.  If cost is not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all wood versions that Amazon has

My daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this Christmas morning.  Of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play.  Her grandma and I played and I was surprised at the amount of things I have learned just from taking her to her lessons!  I'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like Trivial Persuit but that was my only problem with the game.  There isn't questions asked every move.  But otherwise, it is an excellent game.  I would definately recommend it

I bought my girls, ages 7 and 4, this product earlier this spring. It was easy to assemble, but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process.  It has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use. When our play group meets here, the kids line up to have a turn, over and over again.  I would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands.  A very durable product and a fun physical activity

I love light sabers,I got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play,I bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool, this saber is the best, you can fight and the saber will not get damage, i like it very much. I got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight. The light saber full extended is like 3/4 of a meter but it do his job. The electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment. THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

Our 2-year-old loves Thomas the Train, so this was a great gift for her. She has other Thomas items, but they're limited to playtime. This, however, is not only good for playtime, but safe enough for her to take to bed with her (she even kicked her Elmo out to make room for Thomas!). It's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides. A great all around item to have if you've got a child that's really into Thomas

I was a bit afraid after reading the reviews, but this game is a hit with kids all ages. It takes about 3 minutes to set up, but it's not hard and the bees don't fall thru. We played more times than I can count this past week, and everyone enjoyed. I bought it for my 5 year old, but her cousins (ages 19, 17 and 13yo) joined in the fun and actually asked to play. My husband and I also got a kick out of it! Even our 3yo loved it, but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped, she's good!

Our child didn't get bored while we were setting it back up, but everyone was sticking leaves and talking, so I guess it depends on your children's patience or attention span.

In a few words: We all loved it

I chose this railway set over Learning Curve because I believe their prices are inflated, and I was not disappointed with it.  The set is well made overall, with smooth, well-fitting track and sturdy accessories.  My son (3) and daughter (6) have played with the set for hours every day since we got it, both with equal fascination.  It fits perfectly with Thomas accessories we already own.  I have only three small caveats:  1) Buy some "sure track" clips to use on elevated portions of the track.  We use it on a smooth, level surface (hardwood floor), but the clips really enhance the stability for active play.  2)  The round turntable did not spin freely when we got it, because the blue center piece was not perfectly round.  We drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece, sanded down the edges, and replaced it.  Now it's very easy for my kids to operate.  3)  The trains included have slightly wobbly wheels, compared to Thomas trains.  But they are functional, and my kids use the trains interchangeably.  It's a great set, and a real bargain

I originally bought this for my husband, an EMT/FF. I wrote a poor review of company, based upon my entire experience w/ this storefront, and the other items I had purchased. I wasn't terribly pleased with the [...] pen but my husband took it to work and loved it. Said it went off several times from pocket while driving..and the entire ER loved it. Overall, it is fun and writes and does what it's supposed to: make you laugh

I appreciate the previous reviews, but we had already gotten the game by the time I read them.  My family - ages 4, 6, 10 and three adults playing  really enjoyed this game. We played until we had a winner (not too long)and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner.  Just our opinion - but we had a good time

I bought this car for my 4 1/2 year old son who absolutely LOVES the movie Cars.  He also loves those Hot Wheels cars.  I got him this car, and he really liked it.  In fact, all of my kids (ages 4-15) like it!  It's a really cute toy.  It's even great if you are a Cars collector

My daughters (ages 5 and 2 1/2) were given these dolls for Christmas. They love them and play with them every day, especially the 5-year-old. I think the littlest one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully, but she plays with her when her big sister plays with hers.

I'm glad I didn't let some of the reviews discourage me from getting these. All the problems people are having with the limited English can be very easily remedied, if they read the directions fully. First of all, you must switch the doll from "display" mode, by moving the little switch on her back. The doll comes in the mode used so that people can try her out in the store. In this mode, she will only say one or two things in English. One you move the switch, you just have to "wake her up" and hold the button util she's speaking English. From that point on, she should speak English, even after waking up. However, if you turn her completely off via the back switch, you will have to switch her back to English by holding the bracelet down.

I really have not had a problem, and certainly don't have to spend time interpreting what she's saying. That's why they make directions - it tells about the display mode right on the front

I bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt  available in stores. My daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll. Doll speaks both english and spanish. The only thing I dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals, but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth. Its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest

This set is perfect for my daughter's new toy oven (miele) that she received for Christmas.  The pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans.  One of my utensils already broke apart, but that happens.  I have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook, but she IS 3 and is not always careful.  Not sure whether that utensil wasn't made well enough or it's a 3 year old's play, but the rest of the set seems fine.  I would recommend this and the Miele oven

We got this when my kids turned 3, however could have gotten it when they turned 2. We play it every day. It tells you which player's turn it is, it also counts the number of spaces you are suppose to go with you and then it says "you're on the 'yellow' space" as a double check. There are 2 modes and we can play on the "difficult" mode (the difference being with the easier mode you only have to know colors, with the more difficult mode, you have to know the alphabet). The characters are REALLY cute to. Best of all, EVERYONE is a winner - yeah! A concept that is difficult to teach a 2 or 3 year old, but this games does a superb job. The computer chip knows what space you are on so it makes sure that everyone wins within 2 turns (that I've experienced), so those with little patience can "wait it out"

I bought the bean bag toss as a Christmas gift for my 22 month old son. He had played the Bean Bag Toss the first time at the Halloween carnival at the church. It was all he wanted to play that night. I wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day. At just three pieces,it is simple to put together and take apart. Although it says it is for 5 and older, it would probably get old fast for a child that age

This is a great game that is made very well.  It is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors.  It will last us many years.  I bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play.  It will surely be a hit!  My daughter (8 years old) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it.  It has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty.  I would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children.  This game is best played on a table, so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags

MY THREE YEAR OLD SON IS JUST DISCOVERING THOMAS AND FROM READING OTHER REVIEWS AND SPEAKING WITH VETERAN MOTHERS OF THOMAS FANS I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT COLLECTING THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IS IN ORDER TO REENACT THE SCENES FROM THE VIDEOS. THIS SET MADE A NICE ADDITION TO HIS GROWING COLLECTION AND THE PRICE WAS NICE TOO. THE WOODEN TRAINS ARE A BIT EXSPENSIVE BUT ARE WELL WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE PLAYED WITH FOR YEARS TO COME UNLIKE MOST OTHER TOYS THAT CHILDREN OUTGROW OR BECOME BORED WITH ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY RECIEVE THEM

Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&M pink & black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures

I hate spiders (yes I admitt that I make my wife kill them) and so does Miss Muffet...or is she.  As her outfit might suggest, looks like Miss Muffet as a bit of a fetish going on, need I say S&M, and with that said, being pinned (blindly I might add) by this monsterous spider may be more of a turn on then you might think.  You'd expect to see Miss Muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe, blue dress to be exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this 'Twisted' point of view proves to be anything but expected.  I say kudos to you McFarlane for truly reimagining the fairy tale (nursury rhyme, whatever) and giving us yet another piece of art

After reading other reviews,I, too, purchased this to use to practice agility with our dog.  I wasn't sure it would be large enough.  She is an English Setter.  It works perfectly for this size of dog.  She is approx. 35 lbs, med. size dog.

My son is a huge fan of the Thomas & Friends diecast trains and building sets.  Despite the fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys, an important character was missing from his collection: Terrence the Tractor.  Of course, he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in his Easter basket.

No, Terrence is not a train, but one of the tractors that plows the fields on the Island of Sodor.  Terrence is a wonderful character, with his bright orange coat of paint and happy face.  He has one magnet on his back end, perfect for pulling trains (or having trains pull him).  In all honesty, we have not had any problems with Terrence's treads coming off--they are designed to wrap tightly around the wheels when rolling, so no matter how hard my three-year-old tugs on them, they stay put.  Terrence is also a very durable toy--my son has dropped him, stepped on him, ran him into the other trains, and Terrence shows no signs of wear, tear, split wood, or chipped paint.  Finally, Terrence is small enough to fit easily in my son's hands during play, but can also be slipped into a coat pocket during a car trip.

All in all, Terrence is a terrific vehicle, and a perfect addition to a child's Thomas & Friends collection

This large version of Michael Myers is a lot beter than the McFarlane version released ever how many years ago. First the pose is better.Second NO BLOOD STAINS! Don't get me wrong, Michael Myers is a movie killer, but he never got bloody! That was my biggest complaint with the McFarlane version. He does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls, but if you remember from the movie, he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls. Finally third, and pretty cool, the sound effect is diffrent. Instead of Laurie Strode's whiny help me , you get the Halloween theme playing along with Michael's breathing. Remeber the end of the first movie, after Loomis shot him, but the body was missing, the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by Myers' breathing. If you got the NECA boxed set of Michael Myers and Loomis and liked it, get this! If you got the Mcfarlane version, get this! If you just like Halloween, get this! You won't be disappointed! Looks better in person than on the picture

The fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child.  She had a great time using her "magic wands" to see what would happen.  With the bathroom playset, having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool (I assume so Dora could step up to the sink & brush her teeth) pops out was a very fun surprise.  My 7 year old has already spent MANY hours making up princess stories with the castle.  The whole set was a great buy

We have several boxes of these Melissa And Doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them!  My three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again!  YES!  My boys love this too!!!  It's a great exercise for their fine motor skills!  The patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful!  It's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace.  I suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time.  Our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words.

**Not suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of candy.

We bought this toy for our 1 year old son.  It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great.  I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well.
My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder.  Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs.  The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle.  My son fell over with it and crashed on his face.  There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over.
My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!

This backpack has plenty of room for the extra LeapPad books and cartridges we have. I love having them all together with even little compartments for the cartridges to be secure in.

I purchased this from Amazon, having only seen it in photographs.  Based on the online images I expected the top to be opaque pink, and the bottom part to be see-thru pink, so I could see what was inside.  When it arrived the top was indeed the exact color as on Amazon, but the bottom was a pearlized lighter opaque pink.  I don't have any problem with this, in fact I may even like it better, but it was just unexpected.

Overall the case is great.  Just as advertised it will hold 15 dolls in a standing position, with plenty of space in the 2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories.  The doors on top are difficult to open, and I know I will have to help my 4 year old with it at first, until they "soften" up a bit, but at least they won't be flying open, spewing mini plastic platform shoes everywhere.  As one previous reviewer noted, there is a larger open space in the main compartment that isn't great for holding a lot.  I plan on using either a Ziploc bag in that space to maximize it, or attaching a (pink!?!) piece of cardboard or thin plastic to extend the height of it.  We'll then be able to fit massive amounts of clothes in there!

My cart does say "Barbie" on the lid, but the markings are discrete, and tastefully done.

Overall, I like this cart.  It's probably the best storage device for Barbie that I've seen.  It's cute, fairly well-made and will hold a ton.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of the issue with the interior storage, the handle seems a bit flimsy, the wheels are not great for carpet, and it's a bit pricey

I give this Leap Pad book 3 stars for fun because my children were not interested enough to even look at all the pages.They played with it a lot, but did not get even half way through, maybe that just means it is full of fun stuff to do, but since my kids have not gone back to it, I feel it does not hold their interest quite enough. Educational, 4 stars because some of it seemed a bit simple, like the space page. 5 stars for durability because it is no more and no less durable then regular Leap Pad books. Dont like the eraseable pen though. Must cover it each and every time, even between questions. If it's off more then 5 seconds, it dries out.I peronally did not find it very easy to keep picking up and putting down pens. I tried using a pen in each hand, and it dried out, so I had to keep putting down the regular "pen" to cover up the eraseable pen. Pretty annoying

Easy, straightforward interface (for instance, a button for each number) and navigation through cells.  Easy to tell which numbers start with the puzzle and which ones you entered.  Provides time-penalized hints in any cell.  Pauseable and saves your game between (auto-off) power sessions.  Most importantly, this device lets you make "pencil marks"!  I have checked out at least a dozen products and I have yet to come across an electronic Sudoku that electronically lets me enter dots or Xs to indicate which numbers might (not) be in a cell.  It makes me wonder if the people ordered to design and implement these games actually play Sudoku themselves.  The closest I've seen let you enter multiple numbers in a cell and it blinks through them, which I find cumbersome and patience-trying.  Sadly, this thing doesn't do electronic marks either, but their lower-cost solution involves a dry-erase pen that lets you make the marks right on the screen, on top of little numbers printed in each cell's background.  Losing marks in travel is prevented by the recessed contours of the screen.  Why not 5 stars?  Just the fact that the marks aren't electronic, there's no backlight, and the shadows cast by the dry-erase marks can be a little disorienting.  Otherwise, a well-done, fun, and addictive product

I've been an Amazon customer for years, but this is the first time a product stood out enough for me to write a review. I bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter and I figured my 6 yr. old son could use it later.

I was very hesitant, because there aren't a lot of reviews and it's expensive.

Well, we've had it a few days and my daughter has been playing more with "Secrets of the Master Magician: An Apprentice's Manual", which I also bought at the same time (another great gift). My daughter is interested in this and it's easy for her to put things together.

My son is obsessed with it! It's similar (for him) to the Lego creatures he puts together. He needs a little help from time to time, but he can certainly follow the very well laid out diagrams. So far they've created an FM radio, a scifi noise maker, a sound detecting space noise maker thingy, a propeller that spins and flies into the air, a seven segment display, a volt meter connected to the solar cell. After connecting the solar cell, I realized my son thought the solar cell would come on like a computer screen or TV! After explaining it and putting my hand over it; now they both know what a solar cell does.

 - There are 5 books of experiments.
 - Each project has a nice simple color picture of how to connect all the components.
 - All components are clearly marked.
 - The diagrams are a top view. Since the connections are layered on top of one another 2 and 3 deep, it takes a little figuring as to what's on top and what's on bottom. It's easy for an adult. It's part of the "puzzle" for the kids. After we put a few together, they both got it.
 - The pieces seem sturdy enough and snap together easily
 - There is great assortment of parts to create lots and lots of very interesting projects.
 - My kids love the projects. I've been very impressed.
 - It has a cable that you can connect to the microphone port of a PC sound card. I haven't played with this. There is software, it looks like you can turn your PC into an oscilloscope. Looks interesting. There's a whole book for these projects. I just saw the cover, so it's likely that there's even more to it.

My kids are learning a lot with this. While they are putting things together, I can explain how these different parts work. There are lots of opportunities to take the project and modify it by replacing parts, change a light out for the speaker, etc.

For example, my son put the 7 segment LED together. I wasn't impressed. I was hoping to put together a counter, but it just connects each segment to ground to turn all the segments on. There are 750 projects, so maybe there is a counter project. Regardless, my son was fascinated. He changed all the connections manually to count from 0 to 9. He changed the main power resistor to see it go brighter with a smaller resistor and dimmer with a bigger resistor. Lots of implicit learning going on. I pointed to the microwave display and said, "See, that's how it works!

I enjoy seeing my twin four year old son's play with the Read with Me DVD program and CD's. The children are learning as they play. I see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story. This educational toy is very engaging.

The only problem I have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the DVD player it takes several tries to get the DVD player to respond to the remote.

If you're not sure if your little one will really be "into" these train sets, this one is a great one to try out.  It's more fun when you get all the extra buildings, but if it's an iffy situation, then I highly recommend this set.  We bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too sure about these trains.  However, after he received it, he found out that he liked them and well, now we have a bunch of them! The $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play with either!  I just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train.  However, you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from Maxim, who makes Brio trains now, and the train separately as well.  This train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use Duracell.  Energizer only makes it two days in this train but Duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks.  Other than that, highly recommend this toy

I bought this because as a kid my grandparents had one that I would play with constantly everytime I visited, and at the age of 7 was certain I could solve it.  I never did, and eventually it broke, and it wasn't until I was sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something, that I thought I needed something to do while I waited for my computer to unfreeze, or for the network to come back online.  So I bought a rubiks cube, figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats easy to store, and is only one piece.  It came with a display stand, so I keep it displayed next to my monitor, and have co-workers come by and scramble it hoping that I won't be able to put it back, but I always have.  Like I said its a puzzle, but not with alot of pieces, and its portable, so if your taking the bus home, you can kill time with it, then put it back in your briefcase, or backpack.  I love it and haven't gotten sick of it yet

One day I realized that my baby is now a toddler and his toys are all...well baby toys!  I browsed the toy aisles for the perfect, age apporpriate replacements hating to spend more money on more plastic, yet desperate for anything that will engage him for at least 15 minutes and keep him STILL so I can put clothes away, vacuum, sometimes just SIT and play. This does it!

Reliable duplo/lego quality.  Non frustrating because the pieces actually stay together.  Easy assembly.  Of course my little guy is 22 months so I still have to do the majority of the assembly.  I did get this for him at age 19 months and by now he has caught on as to how to put the track together.  He tries to put the cars together but still needs my help to lock the pieces in place.

I am constantly amazed at how much toddlers pick up by watching grownups, so keep putting this back together while your little one is present.  Luca does love to disassemble the track and it is a challange keeping it together however, over the last month, persistence has paid off and he has figured out how to re-assenmble his little messes.  The assembly is easy enough for him to get it on his own!

These chunky toys accomomodate busy little toddler hands  perfectly.

This particular set comes with everything necessary for your toddler to "get to work".  This set has just enough to busy your toddler without being overwhelming!  This set has satisfied my little guy (although I did buy him the Toby (he is just so cute) set too.

My older boys take Tae Kwan Do every night and this set is a staple in the karate bag.  It definately keeps the younger .0brothers and sisters busy and off the MATS.

Other add-ons are available but right now, this set, and the Toby have been just enough!

The price sems high for the seemingly few pieces.  I am the first to admit it is difficult to commit to a 25$ purchase, but as with Lego/Duplo products, the quality and play/learning value add greatly to the plastic parts making it an excellent purchase!

GREAT GRANDPARENT GIFT! Even a perfect toy to keep at Grandparents house!

 Our daughter got the pull and spin caterpillar for christmas (she was 9months at the time). At the time she wasn't able to pull it but loved to chase the caterpillar as it was being pulled. Now at 12 months she is able to pull it herself and loves putting just about anything on the back of the caterpillar.

  The toy it self has a very cute face and when pulled the eyes and ears move up and down.

  The only problem with the caterpillar is the pull string. It is very small and thin allowing it to slip through little hands while trying to pull it.

  Overall a wonderful toy, not only for the balls that come with it but for anything else that your little puts on it

I bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last Christmas at a fancy toy store.  This product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this.  The marble runs are easy to build, sturdy and so much for them to play with.  There are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more "fun" and cool looking marbles as they raced them down.  The kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect.  I LOVE THIS TOY!!!!  My kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time.  You do need a hard surface to build on, since we didn't have a "train table" we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet, that way you don't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..

My daughter rec'd this game as a gift for her fourth birthday.  It was wonderful because my son, who was two could play it too (with my assistance of course).  Now they are 5 and 7 and still play it.  It is a simple game that requires no reading skills and reinforces counting.  I would recommend it to everyone

Everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be Darth for a spell.)

On another note: we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece. It is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display

I got these for my 28 month old daughter for Valentines Day as she is fascinated by skating. They are a pain to put on, but she doesn't mind. They have "beginner" settings, which she used for the first hour and then it was on to the "expert" setting! What I like is all the safety gear come with them, so she knows that she has to wear it "all or nothing". These are great and seem to be safe and sturdy...with supervision, of course

The kit was great I thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors! This toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies,put magginets on them or just play with them! This toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break.If you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one

I love this kit--the puppies are so cute and the project is really fun. I loved the finished craft and it gave my children the freedom to creat whatever they wanted.  Would like to buy more of these to make a whole kennel and to give as birthday and holiday gifts.  All we needed was in the box and the directions were so easy to follow

All year long, my three and a half year old daughter asked for a digital camera for Christmas.  3-weeks before Christmas, she sat on Santa's lap at the mall and asked for a TRUMPET of all things.  I immediately came home and searched online.  Everyone had the colorful play trumpets that were electronic with diferent characters on them, but none of them looked real!  And I'm pretty sure that my daughter was expecting Santa to bring a real trumpet, so I found this, ordered it and it was here BEFORE the estimated delivery date!

It is extremely lightweight (cannot be used as a weapon), each button has a different tone to it AND it looks real (besides the fact that it's not brass).  She loved it!  She plays it all the time and unbelievably, it's not the most annoying toy she has.  I would recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical instruments

My 6 yr old loves this game of War. The food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who. Besides the plankton, shrimp, little fish, big fish and Shark, there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for added excitement. The game is played like war, but the instructions add a slap Jack element. This is not my favorite part. We have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel card, which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger child to play with older children. The ink out card prevents anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other person. This game can go on and on, don't be afraid to adjust some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one and not so complicated.
The cards are made well.

My children (4 & 6)love this game.  It is great because no reading is necessary.  The game asks the questions and even repeats them when necessary.  While my kids don't know all the topics covered they enjoy the game.  The fact that the game makes sure they move the correct number of spaces is great too.  I definitely recommend this game and I will probably buy the next level of it.

I bought this for my son for Christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine.  He has been playing with it almost non-stop since then.   It is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. It also connects with other Matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout.  Based on my boy's interest and use so far, this rates 5 out of 5

My three kids have loved this tunnel since they were two(they are now 5,7 & 9) They still play with it alot. They do a variety of things with it including magic tricks where the child inside will "magically" disappear. It's great exercise too to be on your hands and knees. They also love to play "tornado" with it, where one child gets inside standing up while the others throw stuffed animals into it, meanwhile the child inside throws them back outlike a real tornado does

This is a great toy for kids of any age. We bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1/2. She still plays with it. It folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside, it still looks like new. At my son's 6th birthday party (13 boys, 2 girls), the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm, while the other kids beat them with blow up swords. Yes I was supervising, but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape. Even out cats crawl through it. There are not many toys that are this much fun and durable

I was skeptical about this one.. as I have learned that the cheaper the toy is.. the less my baby likes it. Though he absolutely adores this floor mat. I got it for him when he was 2 months old. He is only 4 months old now but can't get enough of it. The little octopus does make sound when it spins.. but he can't reach it yet. Though its hilarious to watch him try! He gets so frustrated and beats up the other toys, but then smiles in the end when I go spin it for him.

I give this 5 stars because the floormat itself is. I would give it 4 stars but that is based on my baby and all babies are different. The only problems we have with it, which would make it 4 stars would be the fact that aside from the octopus there are no other sounds, and there are no lights. My baby loves sounds and lights. So if you have one of those, expect yours not to want to play as long on the mat in the beginning stages. Ours plays for about 20-30 minutes, then he wants to be moved to his swing so he can look in the mirror and hear the music. But you can get really good tummy time on this and it keeps them entertained and laying out straight (instead of scrunched up in a swing so often) so you can get a few things done around the house.

Oh and we have noticed that our baby will play on it longer, if we go over and play with him every once in awhile. Helping him reach the toys, making the octopus spin, etc. Then we get another 20 minutes to do whatever. So all in all... its a great product...

Just be warned that the little mirror on one of the fish.. isn't a mirror. Its one of those flashy material looking things and the baby can't see his reflection in it.. cause I cant even see mine in it.

If the toys are hanging to low for your baby, you can flip them over the top bar once and they will hang higher, or move the baby on the mat a bit.

I work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy!  My baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast.  All of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through.  It also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on.  It plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies.  I highly recommend

We just set up our playhouse and I'm very happy with it! It's large enough for a parent to sit inside, it was easy to set up and my 2.5 year old son is loving his new playhouse! He really likes the basketball hoop/game side of the unit. I wish there were more electronic noises and interactive components on the walls of the playhouse, but I still think it's a great value for the money

Based on the other reviews, this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson's first birthday present! I am not the least bit disappointed. Colorful, action packed activities everywhere, sturdy, easy to assemble, cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life! There are a lot of girlie playhouses, but this one is the answer for boys.
My son put it together in about an hour, and was ready for the birthday party guests.
Happy Grandmother

This update of the old Big Wheel style "Green Machine" is made to handle the height, weight and wear and tear of big boys (and girls, up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it), yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals.  The main cool feature is the dual lever steering.  Just like with the original hollow model plastic version, pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that kids just can't get enough of.  Yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6, 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway, the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground.

So first, I am amazed at the staying play value of this toy.  For two years now, it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens.  And second, I am amazed at its durability.  The 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an Evel Kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children's toys left and right, and so far, it has held up without a squeak.

This was a million times better value for our hundred spot, than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped.  Definitely consider this for your 5-10 year old boy, even if he already has a two-wheeler.  It's a whole different kind of fun.

***** all the way

My 21 month old daughter received Baby Pooh for Christmas and plays with him EVERY day. She loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change, and bathes with him nightly. He comes with a duckie and bottle of his own. The high chair back does not stay attached to the chair, but Pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter. Pooh is made from hard plastic and, sadly, his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. My daugher is handling the trauma OK, but we are getting her an new Pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much. I recommend it

This train table is a nice size, bigger than I expected. It went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson's Thomas stuff. It seems to be made as well as what I saw at Toys R Us for double the price.

I bought this for our grandson age 13 soon to be 14 and he was very pleased with it.  He did say that it was a little more difficult to put together but he did it and was very pleased with himself and with the results.  Thank you for  making this possible.  The price was right

My son received the smartville ice cream shop for his first bday. he played with it all the time. We bought him the rest of the set for christmas. This is definitely his favorite toy. He is 15 months now and he plays with this set almost all day long. This is one of the best things I could have bought for him. He understands how it works by placing the characters on the round spots. I feel it will be a great teaching tool for when he is ready to learn the alphabet and his numbers

this is a great item. Theres alot going on in such a  tiny little space. The detail is great,from the kraken that can make a boat disappear,to the bone cage.There's a collapsing bridge,a collapsing building,a trap door,runaway mill,and a cool magnetic boat race and more.It comes with Jack,Will,Norrington,and the cannibal chief,but no Davy.That was a little disappointing.But anyway its a fun item for all ages.

I bought this high chair for my daughter's second birthday because I love the look of it. The similar chair made by Badger Basket Toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so I went with this one despite it having no reviews. I couldn't be happier. This high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble. I love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter's room may go through decorative changes in the coming years. I don't forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last. She has several dolls, the largest being her 17" Corolle Lila, who fits beautifully in the chair.  I would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20" doll. While it is solidly built, I am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself (I've caught her trying to several times) because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy! The only real negative is the joke of a chair pad. I actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add to the toy's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance. I highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies. It's made me look to KidKraft for more toys and doll furniture

I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present.  I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it.  We've had it 4 weeks.  What a great pool toy!  Kids love it!  We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine.  I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.  It seems to be well built and sturdy.  I wouldn't hesitate to get on it.  Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case.  It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids.  Overall great gift idea

I bought this for my niece's 5th Birthday, and she loved it! My nephew (8) wouldn't leave her alone, he wanted to ride it. My brother-in-law got on it, and it actually moved him around. It is very durable, thick plastic looks like it will last a while. For the price, if it lasts this summer only, it is worth it

My daughter recv'd this from her grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in the picture. It has worked fine for my daughter she has figured out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to turn it on once in awhile. she likes playing the cds with her name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d.  The only thing i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me checking up on her, she went and poured some kind of liquid in the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment. I have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think i will get it back out and let her play with it again. I have even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they sounded fine. My daughter has alot of the princess furniture in her room and this really matched and is very cute, and we have had no problems with this item so far. (knock on wood).

I bought this CD player for my daughter's 5th birthday not expecting it to last a month. To my surprise it's worked wonderfully. She figured out how to operate it pretty easily and she listens to it every night before bed. We've had it for 6 months now with no problems.

My favorite feature is the compartment for the CD's. It keeps them from being left lying around and getting scratched.

DOND is a fun game, and we've had some lively sessions playing it.  There is an additional (we forget...we got rid of it!)...complicated thing that the game had, and made it "less fun" to play.
You also have to disregard the 'suggestion' regarding "how" to give an Banker's Offer...it doesn't work, so you have to use your own judgement, to "jiggle it"...actually, this makes it even More fun!
All-in-all...from 6 to 60, of we whom have played (if you follow the 'disregard' suggestions)...it's a 4-star fun.

This is a simple pirate ship tub toy with two backyardigans characters. My pirate enthusiasts (ages 6, 4 and 2) love it. It doesn't move or make noise, but it floats well and is sturdy. The best part is that the characters fit in the bottom of the ship for easy storage

The developers of this game did a great job coming up with questions designed to appeal to kids, questions like:
 If you could star in a movie, which movie would you choose?
 If you could eat only one food for the rest of your life what would it be?
 The questions range from simple to a bit more complex, so that kids who like challenges as well as those who don't will enjoy the game.
  Another thing: Although you can follow the rules and play this strictly as a board game, we used it while we were just sitting around the table having a casual chat. Sometimes the kids asked the question, sometimes the adults did...but we all learned more about one another...a LOT more...and many of the questions got us talking about family history, memories, etc. Lots of fun! It'd be great to take the questions along on a trip or while eating at a restaurant since they are surefire conversation starters but not so personal that anyone's "personal boundaries" will be invaded. Plus, there are no right or wrong answers and any information provided is strictly voluntary, revealing as much or as little as the respondent wants.
  One caveat: You will eventually go through all the questions so this game won't last forever...unless you are able to find new people to participate. If so, it be used for years. In terms of fostering family closeness without any threatening or off-limits questions (in short, everyone has to play nicely together) this is great!

I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, three days before her first birthday. She loves taking the pieces out, banging them together and recently, putting them in the correct spaces! The size of the pieces is perfect for a young toddler and the knobs are the right size for her hands. Will definately look at Melissa and Doug puzzles for her again

Imaginext Dinosaurs' T-Rex is quite simply fun to play with. The dinosaur not only is a great toy, with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar. It comes with a catapult with its respective stones (2) that the caveman (also included, with accessories) can operate, to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino.

My 3-year old picked it up since he got it, and he hasn't let go

My little boy is a certified dino-phile, to the point where he's had to teach me to pronounce several dinosaur names (ever tried saying Edmontonsaurus three times fast?). But, like any kid, his favorite remains the T-Rex, tyrant lizard king.

When it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys, this is the most durable by far. Although we've had the same problems getting this to stand at times, as mentioned by another reviewer, that hasn't diminished my son's enjoyment.

To top it off, he's come up with fun new uses for the toy, too. That catapult is VERY good at aiming at our family cat, much to my son's delight

This is a fun toy, just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels. You can ask which one is biggest, what color is this car, ask about the numbers on the cars, etc... that is why I think it is educational to that respect. My son still has this, and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along

I got this for my 2 year old for Christmas. It was a nice present, he enjoys it. 2 things though, it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is. It could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max, and that is two 2-3 year olds. It is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in Big Bird's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money, especially since i didn't pay for shipping

I got this for the price, $4.99.  I put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent almost every waking hour playing with it.  The first thing she asks me in the morning: "Will you play Mermadia with me mommy? Pretty Please?"  The parts come off easily but do not fall off.  My daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for her.  She loves it.

My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.

Yasmin, one of the super-stylin' Bratz Rock Angelz, is in my possession! So, I'm sorry my reviews go in to EVERY LITTLE DETAIL(as one customer complained), but that's how I do it! So if you haven't bought a ticket to info-town, either get the heck outta here, or buy one by reading this review. HERE GOES!

First off, Yasmin has blonde streaks flowing through her dark chestnut hair. Just like the other Rock Angelz(Cloe, Jade, Sasha), Yasmin's hair is awesome quality;smooth, great duraility, etc. That feature makes her great for younger kids because her hair can get messed up many times, then smoothen out. Yasmin has the liveliest color eyes of the Rock Angelz; emerald green. This works as both a strikingly gorgeous feature and hot highlight to the doll. Her lip color, pink, really stands out on the doll. And of course, as most other Yasmin's do, she has the warm cocoa skin color. She has dark blush and sparkles above her eyes.I absolutely adore her chocker. It is too cute! I'd definately say that her jacket has a 70's-80's rocker look to it. It's definately the best piece of clothing on this doll. Just beware that it's difficult to fasten the velcro in the back. The velcro on my Yasmin doll's jacket is practically coming off! Underneath her jacket, Yasmin sports an undershirt labled 'Rock Angelz', with the ever-so-famous red glitter included. Her jeans have no rips or anything. They're just jeans with white stitching, red glitter, a chain half-belt, and little frayed bits at the hem. Now don't get the wrong idea! Just because this doll has a chain, leather, frays, and a belly-jewel(so not a tatoo!), don't go thinking, "Oh no! This doll portrays an image of bad things for our 'little' girls!" She's just a cute rock star singing inspiring songs and wearing totally appropiate clothing. Now, of course, if you still think this doll is innappropiate, it's not my place to order you to buty this doll. I just wanted to epress my opinion;this doll is safe. Anyway, her black guitar is in the same mold as Cloe's red one and Oriana's purplish one. It's a little difficult to position her guitar correctly, but not thouroughly impossible. Her second outfit consists of sparkly mini and rockin concert tee. Yasmin's ankle boots match with both outfits. And I love the fact that both outfits are mix-n-matchable! It rocks! Literally! Her accessories include:glasses, 2 sets of earrings, cell-phone-necklace, bracelets, star brush, lipstick, microphone/microphone stand, and totally-collectible displaying stand!

You've outta have a rockin' time with this rockin doll! She's 100% worth the price($19.99)! Fortunately, I got her for Christmas. In my opinion, she's appropiate and meets the standards of ALL ages(notice I stressed on the 'all'). You're lucky if you get her! GREAT JOB MGAE!

Chelsea&Yasmin(50% My Scene, 50% Bratz)over, & OUT!!!!!

P.S.-END THE WAR!!!

This set was one of the most fun builds I've done with Lego in a long time. As an adult fan of Lego, I highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection. They are excellent additions to any castle or general builder. As a builder, the final construction is impressive in size (18+ inches long), functionality (the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing), and playability (the sea serpent's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning). The catapult was my favorite part. After seeing the necrotic firing action of the Lego Exo-force Mobile Defense Tank's disk launcher; the rapid-fire, long-range Viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with. The lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship's hull. It should be assembled on a hard surface (I tried to build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor, not carried (it will fold in half in the air). A few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set

Our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday.  She's a puzzle nut!  This became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see.  The picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean.  The coloring is beautiful - Mom and Dad enjoy it as well.  It is extrememly well built, sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth.

The only negative, as another viewer pointed out, is the darker bottom pictures.  Harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing.

I bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before I tried to set it up. I will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating...we'll apparently they were not.  I tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together...so at that point I gave up and waited for my husbands help. The two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had(after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible)and once we had the center base up I pushed it and it fell completely apart.  We got it back together but there was no way I felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it.  So in desperation I called the ToysRUs store where I got it and spoke w/ the store manager. She assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that I should bring it back.  I wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place...but what choice did I have. I asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c I wasn't about to go through this again.  When I arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy...exactly what I had wanted it to be when I had purchased it. Unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett...just like some of the other reviewers had said.  So the morale of the story is...if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back...but once its together properly its great....now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world!

My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift last year and he loves it.  He explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the weather doesn't effect it.  We hose it down to clean it, no issues there.  Highly recommend

I bought this for my girls when they were six months old and at two years they still like the colorful birds!  This is a great toy, well made and interesting.  This would also be a wonderful gift

Our family loves this game.  It brings out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to play.  There are 5 catigories.  Movies, weird laws, initials, word meaning, dealers choice.  Everyone takes a turn orchestrating the game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers.   Then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct.  We played many times over Christmas with teenagers and gramdma too!  Everyone was having such a great time we didn't want the game to be over.  Turn off the TV, make some popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun, no pressure to win game

Balderdash is a riot!  It keeps my family in stitches!  My entire family is so full of bull we play this easily.  Playing Balderdash is a family tradition after Thanksgiving & Christmas dinners and everything in-between.  Anytime there is a family gathering the Balderdash game comes out!  My grown sons and their wives are full of bull, the grandkids are now joining in, but, it's tough to out bull the mother of bulls!  Gotta Love It!  Jan

This lovely new set depicts one of America's best-loved and most popular breeds.

The beautiful dun mare with her sparkling white blanket was created using the "Duchess" mold.  Her alert expression and slightly wind-tossed mane is sure to make her a favorite with your young horse-lover.

The sweet dark dun foal has his mama's lovely blanket and sweet face.  Created from the classic arabian foal mold, his thin legs make him a bit more fragile than mother.

All in all, these two would make a wonderful addition to any little equestrian's collection

This is the best value I've seen for a dinosaur set. My sons love it, and several of my friends have gotten it for their own children after they've seen the kids playing with ours. The volcanoes, rocks and mat are a real plus, and the dinosaurs are big enough to be fun for the kids. They play with this set A LOT

My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money

My son got this toy for his first birthday. He's now 18 months and still loves it! When he first got it, he immediately began to dance to the music. You can press certain body parts on Ernie and then he sings about them (i.e. eyes, mouth, ears).My son can now identify his ears, mouth and eyes on himself. Great toy

My son is a college student in Boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school.  I bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun. As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"

This is a great puzzle!  My son is 2 1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day!  It is amazing to watch him, because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own!  And when we are done he is so proud of himself, I love it!  I am online right now looking for more just like it

My almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy.  It is easy for her to control.  My 8 year old thinks it is boring.
I don't think it has any educational value.
The controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end, so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it.

 Well the space is limated but I learned how to deal with it. The set comes with four parts rainforestchamber, bug chamber, aquarium , and ant colony. The aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in. then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big. Finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four. the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since I bought this during winter I will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard. And we all know what you put in a bug chamber. Over all I rate this four stars due to small space. P.s there a bug catcher in it as well

This is a great house,got it at toysrus,has six ring tones at doorbell,dog,knock knock,jibberish,fog horn,etc.,it's so easy to assemble.all you need is a helper(to enjoy assembly)and a power or ratchet screwdriver(you need both)the stove is a little tricky to start but once you start the hole you can use a power drill!your child will love it.Swinging door/window,spongebob chair fits inside(you can probably get a big screen TV in there!)Great for the price $129.0

The only complaint I have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. But the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs. Even the one year old loves it! He likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. Lots of fun and well worth the money

This playset is great - my son loves it.  You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off.  My only complaint was puting it together.  The instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures.  The parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle.  Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help.  Also, a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic

This is a single player game.  Set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic.  The puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated.  By the end, the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before.  Both kids love it- ages 4 and 9.  We helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking "Whoes in that cars way?" Then "whoes in the trucks way?" until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards

I bought this game based on the reviews on Amazon and I am not disappointed.  Even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept.  The beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me.

Not only is the 90's Game fun and enjoyable to play, but the questions and answers bring back lasting memories of movies, sports, TV shows and meaningful events from the decade.  Correctly answering questions by relating them to personal memories and experiences allows all players to relive their experiences from the 90's.  Whether you were a student, young adult or parent during the 90's, this game is sure to invoke sentimental feelings.  I highly recommend it for groups of friends and families

My 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it.  He plays with it just about everyday.  Everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too.  They all love trying to make baskets.
The flaws are that it is loud and I wish the baseball and football did more or made noise.  They don't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises.
Overall it's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained!

My son loves this toy.  It is the perfect height for my 14 month old (he got it when he was 12 months, and it was great then, too).  He can play with it sitting or standing.  He loves to make baskets, and I can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score.  He loves to spin the football, and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat.  He uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house.  This toy is a family favorite

Amazon[.com] recommended this game for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set.  Unfortunately Xactika bears a strong resemblance to "10 to 1," a game played with a normal deck of cards.  If you already know how to play "10 to 1," Xactika may seem derivative.  After trying Xactika once or twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played "10 to 1" instead

Bought this for my boy who just turned 11. Let's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with. Two blinking lights on weapon. One light on helmet which makes the eyes glow. A little pricier than other Bionicles but worth it. Not too hard to put together, just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you don't lose them while assembling the guy. The folks at LEGO are geniuses, sure it's a franchise, but they're doing a great job keeping it interesting

I can't put it any better than the others before me have.  I did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad I decided to spend a little bit more money for a TON more quality.  This is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than I will be (and I'm only 35).

The other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set.  The prices vary wildly.

Yes, it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there.  However, the others are cheaper for a reason... they're junk.  You simply can't do better than this set

We can not stop laughing when we play this game. We bring this to all get-togethers and everyone loves it.I had to buy my mom a new PIT game because I take it all the time. This game is soooo much fun, the more people you play with the more fun it is!!! GET THIS GAME!!

This game is so much fun!!! I do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels. In other words... If you are a huge Star Wars fan like me, then you will love this game!!! It will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level. Another thing I think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something... Anyway, GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!! One and a half thumbs up!!!

This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this).  I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games.  check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play

Someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old. He loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to "color" and develop his hand-eye coordination. He is now 22 months old and we've just used them up and I had to buy the Crayola tub crayons because I couldn't find these at Toys R Us. The Crayola crayons are thinner (which doesn't hold up as well to toddler abuse) and have more colors, but I like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls (my son loves that part, too). These crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub

The nephews loved it.  We sent it to them along with other gifts for Christmas.  Turns out the twin 8 year olds found this to be their favorite gift.  The light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball.  When the lights went out the fun really happened.  Everything went well even when it turned into tackle-basketball.  Not their mom's favorite sport but no harm... no foul.

This Eeyore is so much fun.  I gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby to keep them together, I think there is also something to be learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY."  Just precious.  Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle.  I thought the ears would be easy to break, but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work.    Nana Ka

My 2 year old daughter (and our 4 & 6 year old neighbors) LOVE this toy!  I had it up during my daughter's second birthday party and all the kids loved it!  It holds up very well and I have only had to refill it once (and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug).  Some of the balls are not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this.  It is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes.  I would recommend this for any kids around 4 or under.  The one thing to keep in mind; the kids may be afraid of it at first; my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there

Sooo cute.  Santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter the dog and cat versions of this game.  She and I have already spent several hours playing with her "pets".  Unlike the earlier pets, there is more to do than just care for your pet.  There are games, activities and interactions with pet friends.  There is a whole village of homes and places to visit.

You collect stickers throughout your adventures.  For instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends.  It is represented by a heart sticker.  Everytime you collect a sticker, you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained.

There are three exterior buttons for use to play with, groom and feed your pet.  When your pet ignores you, it means it is time for grooming, playing or eating.

Sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable.  My daughter thinks that is hilarious.  Kids!

The only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark.  Maybe they'll improve upon that in the next versions

My 2yr old got this one and another Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving them around.

The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very durable

These coins are nice and heavy... they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch.  My son uses them like Jack Sparrow does in the movie so he doesn't die in our play battles.  However, they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped.  It would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real US currency that is large and heavy

My 6 & 8 year olds sons received this toy for Christmas. They are HUGE Pokemon fans so just the fact that it has Pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it. Fortunately, it also happens to be fun to play. 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles. The fewest points wins. Each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games. Setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious, however it's not so bad if everyone helps. The 2 best things for me are that I don't mind playing (unlike the actual Pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me!) and it doesn't require batteries!! My 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time. We just don't tell her.
If your kids like Pokemon, this is a good toy

My 4 year old son loves all things Rescue Hero!  His grandparents got the MACC for him almost a year ago now.  I run an in home day care,so I watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son, 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy!  They all love it!  This thing has stood up to all of their adventures! One of the kids I watch was thrilled when he got the same MACC for his birthday from his parents!  He had just went on and on about it, and they couldn't resist.  It is very large, but we already had the firetruck, police car, helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes, so,in the words of my son, we just HAD to get this too!  I highly recommend this toy for all ages!  Great imaginary play

This toy was an instant success with my son, who is six. He figured out how to put together the track in minutes. Unlike other construction toys, Skyrail is not limited to one or two designs. My son can create endless configurations, including loop-the-loops that really work. This toy is also easy to disassemble. The track and connectors seem a little flimsy, but so far -- after many, many uses -- none of the pieces has broken

When I was a little girl I stood along beside the table and watched the adults play. This was how I learned how to play the game. I have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above (90's style). Unfortunately, they have changed the style of the cards on us and I would like to purchase the 90's style. If any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that I can buy some. I really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me

We bought our youngest son the pirate ship seven years ago when he was four. He is now eleven, and is asking for this new updated ship. He has played with the old one for years, outside in the pool, inside, along with the big king castle, and countless other sets that we have. Yes, Playmobil. is delicate, and young children can be taught how to play with it, there are alot of small pieces, but like Lego, it will and does encourage a child's imagination, rather than stifle it.  We have Castles, western forts, city sets, boats, all of it! It does take time to put together, but some of the best memories are of me and my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets the day after Christmas! When you buy toys for your kids, don't look at a toy and say "what does it do", rather look at a toy and ask "what can my child do with this toy"? Playmobil has been one of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos well past Christmas, much more, than anything else. I am keeping all of our collections for our grandchildren.

I purchased this pirate ship for my son's fourth birthday. This is by far the most popular toy in our house! My 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy. There are so many items that come with the ship - from canon balls, swords, treasure chest full of goodies, food, animals and even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored. My four year old plays on his own, or with his friends, and when all three are home they all play together. Definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home!

My 6-year-old got this for Christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it!  They enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations.  It teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best.  My kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures.  A piece of advice though:  This game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations.  Therein lies the problem - or at least MY problem!  I can't find the extra figures for this thing!  Luckily, they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now I can't find them in stock anywhere.  Also, I have not had any durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day.  Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new batteries. You really need alkalines for this game.  Overall, it's what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!

There are always problems with an any type of bed, even an inflatable one. I am actually 21, but I don't have a credit card so I had to use the kid review instead.
This bed is great. Of course there are problems, but they don't outweigh the good that the bed has. It is great to sleep on, you can carry it on trips, you can have it on another bed that is in one place, or on the floor. I do admit, it is somewhat hard to set up, but it is worth the effort, for the sleep is unparralleled. I sleep on it every night and I have had no problems with it at all. I recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress. What is the most important thing of all is this: Is the person you bought it for happy with it

we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is... we have mixed feelings about her.  my daughter, 4, loves her hair because it's so different from all her other barbies, but she hates her feet.  her feet are way too big, even bigger than ken's (my daughter tried making her wear ken's shoes but it didn't work).  another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge (good), and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls (bad because she can't use the other doll's clothes)

I originally bought this monkey on vacation.  I showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it.  How could I not buy it for him doing that?  It was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies.  I eventually ordered a 2nd one from Amazon for my parents house.  So now I don't have to drag it from house to house.  As he gets older, he is liking it more and more

I got this for my 15 month son. HE REALLY LOVES IT! He doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun will await!), but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside & out. there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back. The "oil change" sounds are his fav. HE also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers!) There is also a small storage section under the seat.. The only thing I wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings. For the price it is a great interactive toy!! And for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long, this still captures his attention months afterward!.oh, and this toy can take a beating! No complaints whatsoever! A great find

I bought this for my children's room which has an outer space theme.  The planets are nicely done and look great.  No, they don't glow in the dark all night long... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?!  They certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep!  We have a round ceiling light which I put triangular "rays" around which is now our SUN.
I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink.  BUT, the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (I've even seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive.  We put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package.  It gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away!!

The 3-D Solar System is great.  I rated it 5 stars because I knew there was no sun, so this product was exactly what I expected.  Easy to hang up, glows well, my 6 year old son is very happy with it!  A sun would be nice, but still well worth the money

This is the ultimate in home laser tag fun.  It has great range and accuracy for hours of exciting but harmless fun.  Get your kids away from the TV games and into the real (figuratively speaking) thing.

If you have, two kids make sure you but at least 4 guns.  Once you receive them, you'll experience the need for the two extra guns.  Everyone who sees them will want to play.

Great toy, thanks Amazon.

I just got the Laser Tag Master Blaster a few days ago and I love it.

I've had my eye on it ever since I got the Deluxe for my B-day back in September. I was looking on Amazon so frequently for the price to drop that I got tired of watching so I stopped for a few months.

Then spring came and I got into playing laser tag again with my little brother. I was suddenly filled with an urge to buy the LTMB. I looked back on Amazon and...BOOM! 60 percent off! 20 BUCKS!

I told my mom and dad about it and they said that I could get one. So the next day we began the ordering process on Amazon, through Toys R Us. We checked the shipping charges and...BAM! 15 greens!

So we just figured on our next trip into town we could just go to Toys R Us and see if it would be the same price. It was (minus the 15 bones for s&h). So we picked up a few and went home.

After reading the instructions a million times and doing a few tests I finally figured out how they work. I also found out that they are very much like the Deluxe, except for the shoulder stock, the sights, the fully automatic feature, the 3 shot burst, the shot range, the text messages, and who could ever forget the rocket.

Let me explain the Laser Tag Master Blaster to you: This large tagger is much better for a very large playing field. The Deluxe and the IRT-2X models are better for smaller areas.

The LTMB's laser has a shot range of up to one thousand feet. The laser has three different shot types: the single (fire one shot), the 3-burst (fire a burst of 3 shots, no overheatage), and the fully automatic (fire non-stop).

You can also send text messages (up to 10 characters long) to your teammates and opponents. Retreat...Behind You...Gotcha...Ouch!

The rocket is awesome. Just load, pump, and launch, simple as that. With just twenty pumps the rocket can sail over forty feet, blasting everyone in a 15 to 20 foot radius.

There is a lot more to the LTMB but it would take to long to type, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself.

This product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the UK as a great teaching tool.  It was well received as a gift by the children and their parents. An excellent math teaching tool that the children love.  It is portable, user friendly and has something for those on many different levels, so much so that one father, an engineer, loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son, as well as a game that they can play together.  Math Whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge

I bought this for my nephew's first birthday and my sister told me that he loves it.  When he gets up from a sleep it is the first thing he wants to play with and with him being at the stage where he is trying to stand up; it is a great motivator to encourage him to stand.  Your kids will love this toy and the sounds and lights will keep your child amused for hours

...and they are working out great with our Thomas Layouts.  Melissa & Doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value.  These are educational and your children will learn things like Police Station, Fire Station, Hospital, School, Town Hall, Grocery Store, and Post Office.  There are several different shapes too, including squares, rectangles, triangle, and the various signs.  The buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side.  The trees, ambulance, fire truck, and mail truck are large and double sided.  The various street signs, and passenger cars are a little small, and as the box states ages 3+ and up, I would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard.  The larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old.  The rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4" approx.  Squares are roughly 2 1/4 x 2 1/4".  These blocks are not as heavy as I expected, but still nicely made, and bright colorful additions to playsets like Thomas/Brio train sets.  If your children don't insist on the real thing, this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product.
The only drawback is the wooden storage box doesn't come with a sliding plexi cover like the Melissa & Doug pizza set or beading set does.  That would be really nice for storage and secure those little pieces that we don't use

This game is very easy to learn.  Each of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes, height (tall & short), color (white and brown), shape (circle & square), and hollow/solid.

The goal is to get 4 of the same attributes in a row (for example, you could have 1 tall white circle, 1 short white circle, 1 tall brown circle, and 1 short brown circle in a row, and that would be a winning set because they are all circles, even though they vary with respect to the other attributes).

The catch is that your opponent picks the piece you have to place on the game board.

This game is similar to SET, in that you are trying to make winning patterns across several attributes.  It is different because you are also trying to block your opponent from making winning patterns.

I do wish this game were less expensive so that more people can enjoy it.  Not everyone can drop $30 for a game.  It is a beautifully made wooden game, but it would be just as much fun if it were made of something inexpensive and priced under $10.

Nevertheless it is a game worth owning. And, for trivia buffs, this game was futuristic enough to appear in an episode of Star Trek Voyager :)

It is fun!  And most importantly educational. It has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot.  My kids like that part. They are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game, we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges.  Next year my youngest will want one too, I am sure, as she wants to play theirs,but she is just too little yet, another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..

I don't know why poor Scrat got so many bad reviews. My kids absolutely LOVE this toy. They laugh hysterically every time and they're 4 1/2 and 7. He does have a tendency to fall down and doesn't scoot very well. But the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money.

Ok, this toy does not deserve 5 stars but the other reviews were far too harsh.  The first 30 minutes of my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price.  As a stuffed animal it's very cute but not too cuddly because it's hard plastic under the fur.  I love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like I do.

Here's another trick.  Put Scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen, then have someone bring in the family pet.  When I lunged at the dog's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder.  This may sound cruel but I assure you the dog was not hurt and now enjoys showing Scrat who's the boss whenever we turn him on

My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations

I have been in love with this game ever since I first played. It was a favorite at choir parties over the holidays in Chicago. Since I have moved, I keep one copy at my permanent address and another at my vacation home. It is great for all ages. We are very loose with the rules and find teams the most fun. It doesn't matter who wins. As long as we play, play, play...we laugh, laugh, laugh!

Most Old Skool fans are angry he's not a VW Beetle anymore. I kinda never liked beetles anyway, so Im happy with the new unlicenced thing. It looks like a mix of a MINI and a Peugeot. He transforms better than most, the picture does'nt do him justice, it makes him look stiff. Actually, for how bulky he is, he's amazingly bendable, I particularly like that his "door/shields" are'nt attached to his arm, their on a cuffling that rotates so they wont be too awkward like many of the others with "door/shields". The Jetski Jetpack adds an unneeded extra flair to an already awesome robo mode. And as an extra retro touch It has a tempurture sensitive decal on his chest/top of the car that must be held for a minute before it will reveal the autobot logo [just like his original 80s version]. I DO wish he had come with some sort of weapon, but I have a few other transformers from this same generation that don't really need BOTH that THEY came with. What's even MORE awesome for me is that I bought this at the grocery store, as one of the very few toys they had in thier christmas section, for $10 if your looking for just any ONE good transformer, bumblebee is a good choice. If you have Optimus, this one looks great standing beside him. Transformer fans Don't Delay, pick this one up! I can't wait to see movie's camaro bumblebee in july

My daughter purchased this with Christmas money and it did not work at all. We reported this to Amazon and they took care of immediately. I was very impressed! Now we have a new toy that she loves that works great. It is fun to play with and a storage container when she's finished.

Even though I'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations, this model has treated us well.  We got this monitor (with dual receivers) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear & crisp.  Reception was perfect in the basement, in the frontyard, in the backyard...even at the neighbor's house.  One of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one.  The second receiver finally stopped working last week & after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research, I decided to go with the same, trusty, inexpensive monitor and it works great!  I've never slept with a monitor in our room (because our babies stay with us for a long time) so I don't know about nighttime quirks.  I keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps....and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me. :)  Baby #3 is on the way & I'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we don't need it anymore.  So, $40 over the course of 3 children isn't bad!

My husband and I travel a lot and someone told us about this on one of our last cruises.. We actually watched 2 people playing it as well. So my husband actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for a Christmas gift. Surprised me!!
We plan on taking it with us on all our trips. We will be able to use it
on cruises, on planes, wherever we may have to play the waiting game. We know its good for 2 people on up!!! It seemed like a fun game

Bought this one recently for my eight year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it.  More challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games.  I highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing, thinking spatially, understanding the consequences of a move or moves, and introducing the concept of strategy

My son and I thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work. This kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble. The screws require more 'adult strength' (he would start them and I would finish) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands to hold and assemble. But hey, that is why it was so enjoyable - we did it together! It is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone 'my Dad and I built this'

This is a very handy product to have around for our 3-year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling.  The AC adapter is a life-saver for long car trips.

Just as an aside note, the adapter does NOT look like the one in the picture.  It is gray-and-orange, like the adapters you seen in the store

This is my daughters first "real" baby doll. She is almost 2, and I have never seen her love another toy like this one. She loves to give the baby kisses and feed her with the bottle it comes with, and I bought an extra outfit so she can change the baby for bed. This doll is really pretty compared to other baby dolls I have seen lately. The skin is a very soft, nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso, and smells like sweet baby powder! I was pleased when I was able to wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily. I love all the accessories that you can get for the Little Mommy dolls too. I highly recommend this one

We recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend's child who used it until he was eight (would not give it up sooner). My son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four. This bed is durable! The bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new. It is so easy to wipe clean. My son feels that his bed is special and just adores it. He sees "regular" beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car. I have a feeling he'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end. Five stars

I purchased this as a Christmas Gift for my 1 year old nephew.  Very pleased with the online price through Toys-R-Us and Amazon.com, it was $50.00 less than in a retail store!  Very prompt shipping, had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools.  Very nice quality wagon, top of the line and well worth the money.  Rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children.  I also purchased the pad set.  Fits perfectly, looks great nad comfy ride, but be sure to purchase the pad set for the Model #29 All-Terrain Cargo Wagon (BP-29), as other pad sets will not fit!  Very nice onverall. Don't hesitate to buy!

I had to buy my 4 year old a new Leap Pad after his old one wore out.  He is currently obsessed with Spiderman so I grabbed this one.  I didn't realize it came with the Spiderman book I was going to buy him soon anyway (saved me $15)!   So far the new Leap Pad and Spiderman book have been a huge hit!

this elmo item is pretty cool. if ur child is an elmo fan then im sure you know how annoying these elmo doll/ toys can be.. oh jeez the voice is so loud and it echoes.!!! however this one is far less annoying than the rest because he hums when you plug his mouth -- im srry i meant ta say when you give him his pacifier (lol)-- you just hear an adorable hum sound. Overall this is a cool gift. Theres is an off button I only wish there was a lower volume button for early morning play

This wagon was easy to put together.  We use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park.  It is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap.  It was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter.  It is very easy to pull around and is very durable

We absolutely love this wagon! My 2yr old will ride as long as I want to walk, stop, detour, whatever...she's glued! It is huge & on the heavy side. But also huge(you can carry so much/many children)w/ great quality & durability. I can easily see us w/ this wagon for years to come & would suggest it to anyone comparing.

I purchased the Parents Magazine version first and my one year old son didn't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this Hasbro toy I purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since.  The buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time.  He also enjoys teething on the keys.  I highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys

This McQueen is different than the regular McQueen - slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on both sides - it is supposed to be the McQueen that appears after the Radiator Springs team fixes him up...my son was slightly disappointed though because the wheels were not white.  I found out there was yet another McQueen with the whitewall tires.  Go figure

I say that because the paint on these cars chips VERY easily.  The Hamm car was already chipped sealed in the package.  My son's Matchbox cars, which get tossed into their basket quite regularly, don't seem to chip near as easy as the Cars ones do.  Never-the-less, kids don't care.  Though, my son (who is only 3-1/2) is wondering why they didn't make a red Ramone or the announcer Cars (Bob and Darryl)??

Also, FOR COLLECTORS, the Sarge and Fillmore are shown on the back of the card as being sold as individual items, but on the back of the Hamm card, they are not shown.  I have as of yet see them sold individually on the Supercharged card

I enjoy playing with this toy and it trains me to be a good Mom.  Your tamagotchi's appearance depends on how you care for it.  Mine turned into Mametchi. Mametchi is a really good character to have.  I have enjoyed this toy so much.

YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The v4, the newest american tamagotchi, is much like its previous japanese counterparts, the entama and uratama. This tamagotchi goes to school, interviews for jobs, and then has a career. Each career has its own game, so there are many more games on this tama than the v3. There is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail. [...

I read the reviews before buying this product, and I do agree that it is messy with the markers, suitable for children that are a little older.  It is fun, and very cute, but a little messy to wash off.  I just buy a pack of baby wipes at the dollar store, and let the kids clean off the screen with them, and then throw them out.  It works wonderfully, and the problem is solved, since the included sponge is not very helpful.  I would purchase this again, especially for the price

Anything Leappad is great . Its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet. My son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of Leappad. At 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly. I highly recommend This and any other Leap pad book and toy . Most schools have dropped Phonics from the classrooms and Leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..

I would recommend this game to any and everyone completely.  I would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player.  Ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it's sooo much fun.  Most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few.

I would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products.

Never got tired of the game and like I said I recommend it to everyone.

Thanks,

The game itself is actully pretty good.  You can go through the entire Price is right game or you can just go to each section.  Like if you just wanted to do the pricing games, there's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc...

There are times that the graphics of the game lag, which is kind of odd since to me since I wasn't playing it on a computer, but on my DVD player.

The pricing games are 'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games.

You can technically play this game by yourself, but it's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have

My daughter got this for her 6th birthday.  She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister.  One of them is using it all the time.  The 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her.  My 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD.  My 3 year old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what she can.  Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD.  I wish there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat

This is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while now.  Usually, we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it.  This brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 & 2) and the included figures are great.  This toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price.  I highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series.  Not only does it keep my sons busy (oh yeah)  but it also helps built their imagination as I hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs.  Imaginext has even come out with "NEW" dinosaurs in this line which can be found at Target or other stores (I have found that TRU has a limited selection).

This is a nice toy for kids to ride on.  My daughter loves the little horn.  There are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music.  That does not work well at all.  There are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either.  It's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features don't work well.  Worth the buy if a family is really into the John Deere theme

This is a great doll--we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere, feeds her, reads to her, puts her to bed, covers her with a blanket, and obsessively pats her on the back and tush.  She's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself.  You might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head, but in fact they are very soft and pliable, and the trunk of the body is all cloth, like a pillow, with a bean-bag tushie.  The headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well.  The eyes don't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls, the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll, and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks.  We'll see how "Maria" holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out, but she seems pretty durable.  What a great purchase!

I agree that the Denver reviwer is totally out to lunch. This doll greatly resembles my daughter's friend Jenny Liu. Jeeny  was born in Taiwan. Chinese people don't look any one way and to expect them to is racist, like saying they all look alike.
 The hair ornaments are plastic but they do look good . The dress looks redder when you display her out of the box.Fabric quality is better than average for Mattel. Her hair is also much nicer and has more style than Mattel had been giving us. I think this doll bodes well for  better things to come  in this doll series.

The Big Bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the cheapest $1.99 jugs.  The only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate).  My youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard.  I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back.

If I had to gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution.

We also go through a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand.  But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard

I am confused by the poor reviews of this product. My daughter received this toy from the Easter bunny this year and the whole family plus Grandparents/Aunts/Uncles etc. have had a ball with it. It creates huge bubbles round or long, that float in the air for quite a bit of time. I do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work...but for the price I have to say this toy is WELL WORTH IT! We also made our own solution (Granny's recipe) and it worked...very messy and sudsy though. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles

My 8 yr old grandson wanted this for Christmas but the price was over $100 so when I saw it for under $15 on Amazon, I got it for his birhtday in February.  He and his 9 yr old brother LOVE it!  I also purchased one booster pack at the same time.  Then I found another game and booster pack at Target for a very reasonable price. So he got the game system, two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $50.00!  Both he and I were happy!  (The only reason I give this a "4" is because the games are a bit hard to come by

I bought this game for my 7 year old last winter - because he loved the book so much.  He quickly mastered the game, which requires you to earn state cards by recognizing certain items about each state, such as the color of the card, whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if the state nickname has a person's name embedded in it.  All his friends liked the game when they came over, so I ended up buying and giving at least 6 more as birthday presents for his friends and for a niece and nephew.  But, more than that, this game has spawned a further interest in geography in my son.  He began playing with a wooden puzzle of the USA as a result of the information on the game cards. In doing so, he taught himself most of the capitals (which are also on the game cards) and the shapes of the various states.  He continues to want to learn more about US geography.  I highly recommend the book and game for ages 5 and up.

My granddaughter loves the buckets.  They are large and easy for little hands to pick up.  They make great hats and are great for putting things in as well as for the coordination of putting them on top of each other.  The colors are bright and the plastic is sturdy. A great gift for little ones and older ones as well.

I don't care if it stops working tomorrow... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money.   (you can get them cheaper at Target though)  She was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone... and now she has "her" phone she is just delighted.... she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk.... so far this phone works great, but like I said... it is such a cool toy I'd go out and buy a new one right away.

While nothing beats wood blocks (in my opinon) we had these first, and they are fun! We like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate, and not painful if they fall on you!  The only downside is that they are large, and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle-they JUST fit.  Storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space; so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box. It's worth the hassle if you have space for them and don't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to

After assembling a Dora's Talking Cash Register that scans the wrong items, a Dora's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this Christmas!  This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect.  Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker.  My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. So what if it doesn't!  It will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on.  I would recommend this toy- very cute and fun!

We LoVe this game. We were first introduced to it at our children's preschool where it fast became a favorite at "free choice time". The children engaged in it delightfully and playfully. Everyone has fun. The game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was. I worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were "better" at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged, BUT have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school. The board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for. It is a challenge even for us BIG kids. I would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game

This is a good toy for a toddler, not a baby. I've used this toy in two different setting (first as a nanny and then as a mom) and both times, the babies were terrified of it. It's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old. The balls fly everywhere and you've got to run about after them to keep it going; unless of course, you've got a toddler, then they can run about after the balls (which seems to be half the fun for them). Good toy, but not until maybe 14 months.

My son cannot wait to get a bigger set.  Compared to other magnetic building sets Geomags is, by far, better quality although it is also more expensive

I purchased both of the Mega Bloks Pyrates Ships and have built two other Mega Bloks vessals before, namely the Man-o-War models from the Dragons line and they wer both more difficult to construct than this one so if you want a challege try finding them instead. The first thing I noticed when I opened it up was the lack of pieces in the set, almost the entire ship simply snaps together, a ten-year-old could do it. There isn't a lot of rigging like in the Playmobil series that will keep coming undone either. All in all it can be assembled in 30 min to an hour. The finished products are full of detail and Mega Bloks has gotten better at it each time, anyone who follows their Dragons line will know what I mean. I'll post a review of the Phantom next and I caint wait to get the Privateer ship Blue Beard's Avenger it looked massive at Toy Fair. With the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 films coming out this line is sure to be a hit

My 14 mo old son just got his go kart today.  He loves it.  He loves pushing the button and making it go.  He hasn't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet.  My 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine (about 40 in tall and 35 lbs).  She received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only.  They have had the best time today playing with the PW go kart.  I agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it.  (The razor go-kart also has a thumb throttle control)  We got the Lil Quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she didn't have the big 4-wheeler.  Now both kids can ride their 4-wheelers together or their go karts.  Thanks Santa for 2 great gifts

I bought this for my 5 year old grandson, he is VERY active and I thought it would be a good way to burn up some of that extra energy!  Not only does he love it, but so does his 2 year old sister.  My daughter tells me that they both dance and dance, until they fall down laughing.  This was certainly a good buy

Being a preschool teacher I use these all of the time. I have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them. Even if you don't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages. Large, unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way. For infants, toddlers, and preschoolers I will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color/paint/glue to their hearts delight

Also it'a hard to get the things out and this makes it fun. I play this came with my dad. I got the game because it has shrek on it. I win this game sometimes.

I bought this for Christmas for my three children ages 4 (twins) and 18 mos. Although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm

I bought this set for my 3.5 year old.  We have had a great time putting it together on several occasions in the last couple of weeks. Once put together, my son imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers.  I am not very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent, well-illustrated and clear, and I had no problem with them.  (My only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a different shade of color from the ones in our set, and took a moment to identify.)  At first my son just wanted to put together the foam walls, but the second time around he wanted to help constructing the walls of the castle.  By imitating me, he was able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather well.  He also figured out how to make the soldiers all by himself, with their arms, legs, helmets, swords and shields.  Through doing the set I also was able to explain that you have to build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and floors, and the third time we made the castle, he was repeating this point to me!  The drawbridge is really fun and well-done.  It raises and lowers very smoothly.  This particular set is really only designed to make the castle, so it's not really meant for making many different things like the other Superstruct sets.  But this was our first one and I have no regrets.  Assembly time was about 30 minutes the first time, but after you do it once it seems closer to 15 minutes.  The pieces are high-quality, fit very well, and are generally a joy to handle and see.  The castle looks great once assembled, and will impress any adults or kids who see it

I bought this wireless weather station as a gift.  The recipient loves it.  For the price, he is really enjoying it.  The only things he would change are:

-interface to computer so that data could be tracked
-display of actual barometric pressure value

These two features are available on more expensive models so I imagine in the future we will be upgrading

My 7-year-old daughter loves this tub of K'nex, and has now foresworn her LEGOs.  400 pieces does not go as far as you might expect, however; you may find yourself shopping for an expansion set soon.

LEGO:
  * you can build houses
  * simple stacking approach
  * upgrade to Technics for 3D building
  * those adorable little LEGO people
  * wider variety of pieces and sets

K'Nex:
  * 3-dimensional construction
  * more complicated trigonometric approach
  * you can build bridges
  * everything can rotate

And I saw a K'Nex set that lets you join LEGO and K'Nex ..

Both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and endlessly dressing Dora. Her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the clothes, too. We are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - Dora needs a place to sleep!

Dora is well made and sturdy, and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done.

And I have to admit ... I've been known to dress Dora a time or two myself. We have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well, but it doesn't seem to bother my little ones at all

Bought this for our girls, 2 and 4. Huge hit, even before the batteries were put in the blow dryer. This set is great for several reasons, and I'll try to list the top few. First, the dryer actually has a little fan in it that whirrs loudly enough to seem real, but not so loud as to disturb the cat when she is getting her fur done. (uncommon for a kid's toy) Also, the nail polish and eyeshadow are both made to open and "use", but no mess. And once you have removed the inner packing materials, the bag is large enough for headband and tiara storage. A must for today's Princess. The one thing I will caution you about is the curling iron. If your child has longer hair like my girls do, it can get tangled when hair is being "curled". Fortunately, the curler has no moving parts, so tangles are discovered long before any permanent damage is done. All in all, a pretty sturdy little set for $15. Great for practice make-overs and such, but probably not for experienced princesses, as there is no actual make-up involved, just imagination. Perfect for my house! No glittery door handles or perfumed pets!

Why do some people call Bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz'? Are you guys mad? They are just dolls. They are made of plastics. So what they wear SHORT mini skirt? They just DOLLS. If you hated mini skirt soooo much, well don't wear them.
I saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts.
THEY ARE JUST DOLLS, okay? No need to argue if they wear short mini skirts.
Anyway, about this doll I am totally adore her. She is very pretty and very ROCKSTAR material (I don't know how 2 spell.I don't care about her having tatoos. Lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a rockstar material.

I bought these for my 5 year old son who is a huge Car's fan. He was using matchbox cars and pretending that they were Lightening McQueen and friends, but when he recieved the set of these he was so excited. These cars are larger than matchbox cars, and are heavy for their size, good quality!! Great for the Car's fan in your life

I got this for my 5 year old, who started kindergarten this fall, and she is in love with the whole school concept.  She loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset.  Her friend came over one day and played with it, too, and they took turns being the student and teacher.   I ended up buying another set for her friend's birthday.

Fly Through Spanish is some of the best software for the Fly pen available.  You can write a word in English and hear the Spanish translation, or write a Spanish word and hear the English translation.  The translator will also spell out translations for you (my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly, especially if you're trying to write them down).  The cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn Spanish words.  Fly Through Spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play.  I was very impressed with the verb charts.  They actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs.  Fly Through Spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing Spanish words.  Please keep in mind that this software will not teach you Spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self-study program.

I hope that Leapfrog releases more languages, especially French

Any game that gets my husband dressed up in a tiara and earrings while playing a board game with his girls, is a GREAT game! It's simple to play for anyone over age 3 (unless the child is orally fixated- there are smaller pieces, so use YOUR better judgment!), is fast enough to hold a child's (and adult's!) interest, and let's everyone relax and not worry about rules- we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly. It has been a great gift for other friends as well as it's not too well-known.

Santa Claus brought this game for my daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it! It doesn't take terribly long to play, so it's a great game to hold the attention of a nearly 5-year-old. We've even talked Dad and big brother into playing, and there's a (playful) fight over who has the crown. The perfect gift for little girls. Thank you, Santa

This is a well engineered product; I cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).

My toddler (22 months) LOVES this doll.  There's something about his wide open mouth and little round nose that enchants her.  She actually threw over Elmo for Ernie.  I never thought I'd see the day.  Ernie is carried all around with her, and the nose gets lots of kisses.  Great toy for girl or boy fan of Sesame Street

I played this when I was young so I thought my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy it too.  She got to pick which color she wanted to be, and we counted how many ants to get into the pants.  It took a little practice, but she got plenty of ants in and had soooo much fun.  We really had a great time

After I read the reviews on this toy, I wanted to cancel my order. Thankfully I didn't because my kids love it. I have two boys 5 & 9 and they love bowling with this toy. My kids have played with it since we got it in Feburary. In the reviews, people said the toy broke soon after playing with it. My kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems. Everything still works great; the pins, the sound, and the ball return.

I am quite fond of this character.  Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but you have to understand where he's coming from.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity.  Then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and, as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation.  Fusing his mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry.  This highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book.  He may not make a great center piece, but the figure is good looking, none-the-less

This is the only figure in the Apocalypse series that dose not have a variant figure. Kinda makes you wish it were the Sentinel series, and if you can find them, most of them are variants that you might actually want. I was fortunate enough to hit Wal-Mart at a time when the shelves must have been just stocked, because the racks were full, and all five variants were right there in front. Needless to say I bought all 5. But Maestro, as far as I know has had one appearance in the entire Marvel Universe, so what variant is even possible.
Despite some protests that this is "another Hulk figure" this is not some namby pamby rehashed Hulk with screaming action, fist pounding, and slightly purplier pants that we've seen a dozen times before, but an almost entirely all new figure. One reviewer said the body was based on the Smart Hulk figure, but I wasn't lucky enough to snag one, so I don't have a basis of comparrison.
However, he is well muscled, warty, and weathered alot like he looks in the included issue of Captain Marvel. And if your wondering just what exactly to do with him, fear not, Captain Marvel is to be released in Series XV near the end of this year. Then he can go a few rounds with your Maestro. Now ML, where's our Legends 2099 Spidey? (He was also in that CM comic.)
He is a good figure, could be a little bigger, like more on scale with Juggernaut from Series VI, but he does come with the Apocalypse piece whcich is a great figure in and of itself

The Maestro, the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the Hulk, comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty Apocalypse.  Apocalypse being the kick butt 14" giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series.

Maestro Hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst.  His beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head.  He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you.  Overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey Hulk from the Galactus series.  Talk about alpha and omega

We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old.  The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around.  We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side.  We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable.  I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries.  I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water

My one-year-old son had a great time playing with these blocks ...  He loved the colors and shapes.  He really enjoyed knocking down my block creations.  We had such a good time playing with the blocks that I decided to go on-line to buy him some.  I was shocked at the price.  I cannot believe [what] these blocks cost ...  For thirty-two foam blocks?!?!?!?!  Forget it.  It's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive; they're great fun, but not worth the price

This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though

I was so glad when my little sister got this game for her birthday! Unfortunaty our version wasn't like the version I had when I was young. For some reason the people stand didn't open or close very well. So while for some you could smack down, others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get to lay flat. Not only that but when we would start a new game, you're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the stands would flip out. Well for the red board they didn't flip so well, in fact only a few would flip up with out help. That could have been my fault when I put the pieces together.
The game was still fun, althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister not to exclaim out loud that she's glad of who she got because she likes her hat. Although I didn't have a problem with her picking her person instead of doing it randomly,(like you're soppose too) I still love this game and forever will.

I've been consistently impressed by the Bionicle toys from Lego, and the Rahkshi are no exception.  Wish I was young enough to actually play with this stuff.  Sigh.  Anyway, Rahkshi take the Bionicle can-sold figures to new a new level of articulation.  In total, joints are found at the neck, shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the Rahkshi weilds.  Then there's  the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air.  Each one of these things appears to come with a miniature CD full of Quicktime promotional stuff for the toys, game, web site, etc.  The voice is a bit melodramatic, but it's still kind of neat.  I like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just bought...sort of redundant, since you can look at the one in real life, but nifty all the same.  One thing that mildly disappointed me is that the Rahkshi's weapon isn't really an independanly existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the "hands" is only attached to the hands, not the heads of the weapon.  This isn't a really big deal, except that it means you can't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand.  This could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces, of course, but it does mean you'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else.  Overall, a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work, or actually played with.  Educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles, as in any Lego set.  Durability seems good so far - Lego is pretty sturdy stuff

Bought for 2 year old twins... it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party.  The only thing that doesn't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time.   Definitely a great gift.

This is the greatest thing, I was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn.  Not only has it lived up to my 3 year old, but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play, it has not torn.  It sparks great imagination.  All her friends go to school now, this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also.  And best of all, we can store it anywhere when we are done, she has even learned to close it up and put it away.  I highly recommend this bus to all!!

I got this game for my then nearly 4-year-old daughter and a year later she still enjoys playing it.  The game is VERY simple and does not require reading. All the parts and pieces are high quality. It's a good opportunity to work with numbers and measuring, plus the game goes fast so you can play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you have the time/inclination.

The object is to create the tallest character by mixing/matching 5 parts (feet, legs, body, head, and hat).  The character pieces are brightly colored and fun and include: ballerina, doctor, fireman/woman, policeman/woman, cowboy/cowgirl, and a clown.  A roll of the die determines which part you select.  The die has both pictures and words--except for the WILD side which is printed in red.

After the characters are assembled each player measures with the included ruler (you can choose centimeters or inches) to see whose character is the tallest. It's a sliding ruler with a base so the kids can actually fit their character inside and line up the top with the corresponding number on the ruler.

I wouldn't recommend this game for kids beyond 5--it may be a little too simple.  But for 3/4/5's it's a great game

I first became aware of "Eat It" through an article in the Washington Post. My family enjoyed playing the game so much that we invited the creators of "Eat It" to appear at an event in our local community. It is a game that truly the whole family can have fun playing together. My seven year old daughter, Emma, was thrilled to learn that one of the questions asked in the game was about a candy bar that was called "Fat Emma", and was hoping that it was still being sold,(it isn't). GREAT GAME

I was a bit miffed when I found out that the photo booth really doesn't take photos.  I guess I should have thought about that a bit more.  Overall, it's just fine

I love the Luke Fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely, it is light, and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real. I would not even dream of fighting with it, I would think it would break in a few days of fighting. There is not much to say except it is the best Fx next to the Darth Vader and it looks cool in the dark. It is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off

Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry.  She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble.  It is also very sturdy.  She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break.  I would recommend this doll carrier.  It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy

You know the family games that you regret buying, especially when you see your child coming at you with it on a rainy day, saying, "Will you play this with me?" Well, Rat-a-Tat-Cat is not one of these.

It's simple enough to learn, but there is enough challenge in it to keep even an adult guessing. Rat-a-Tat-Cat was a gift to our family, but when my youngest daughter (age 4 or 5 at the time) got the hang of it, it became her favourite and here's why: 1)Though she was just learning numbers, she could understand the game, 2)The guessing part of the game put her on equal par with adults, to her delight. 3)Even for a busy adult, it's easy enough to sit down and play this game and actually can be relaxing. 4) If a guest came over, my daughter was able to explain the game rules to the guest and soon she'd have even teenage guys sitting cross-legged on the floor trying to get rid of the rats. Good ice-breaker.

Simply put, rats are bad, cats are good. High points ~ you don't want them.  The higher the number on the card, the more rat-power in the drawing. Zero is the best, with rats gone and a cat installed as a happy Statue of Liberty. The drawings are whimsical & clever.
The reason it's a success as a game for all ages is because though it appears simple, there is the element of not knowing what your cards are and even if you peek (with permission), opponents can take your best away from you. So, if you don't mind losing to a kid and making that kid's day, as well as having a laugh, go ahead and get this game. My daughter is older now and we still play it.  She's also learned to be a good loser :-

My son received this as a christmas gift and loves it. Took a little bit for him to understand how to work it. Only down fall is that it won't run on carpet. Requires hard floor or table to sit on.
Goes really fast

I read about this RC racer in  Family Fun magazine and it got best toy for 10-12 age group and they were Right!  It is alot of fun to put together..not too hard, but a good challenge...It can also be made into a different model,we went online to lego and got the directions.

It is  also sturdy, maneuvers, speeds up to 13 miles in hours and can take all kinds of terrain including snow jumps. The battery has given us about an hour of hard driving.The remote is alot of fun to use. I loves it...its spendy, but I've already had hours of fun

My 2 year old loves it... though one set of grandparents can't stand the noise so if you don't like noisy toys - obviously this isn't one for you. Otherwise its great! Runs out of battery very quickly though.

My 9 month old received this for Christmas and loves it!  He is not quite crawling yet, he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy.  So far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze.  The voice and phrases it says are so very cute too, we love the little giggle and when it says "Hello Baby"!! This is an adorable toy

My son turned 4 on Tuesday and I had bought this and was saving it as a birthday gift! He ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT! He has spent hours and hours of time already sitting and playing with this playset and his turtles. Even my husband thinks it's cool! It wasn't too difficult to put together and it stays together quite nicely! Great toy for a 4 year old that loves TNMT

We (my husband and I) brought this toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with it, I realized it taught her to follow directios.
It's a mode where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one by one as you press them and I was truly amazed at my baby actually following the directions.
This toy also teaches numbers. Overall, this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the toybo

I just found this car at ToysRUs for $3.49; plus others in this series. I came online to Amazon to see if I could find characters not available at the store and I was blown away by these prices--$29.99???? You've got to be kidding me! I bought the TOY cars for my five year old son to PLAY with--the only reason I can see TOYS being priced this high is they must be trying to catch collectors. I'm glad I could find what I did at a local store; I definitely would not pay these high prices...
I would have been very happy to buy others in the series from Amazon, but at these prices I am definitely NOT going to!

My daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday. Even though the box says for ages 7 and up, and even though she's not the most nimble-fingered kid, she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help. The materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick, colorful yarn. The loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time. She enjoys watching me knit, but doesn't have the dexterity yet to knit herself, so she's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like

When it first came out almost 20 years ago, I saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take on a Christmas skiing vacation with my family.  Unfortunately, my mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead.  We didn't have gifts that year, but we did made it to Colorado and spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing this crazy game.  It doesn't matter if you can draw, it's how fast you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they give you, and how ridiculous everyone's scribblings usually look.  I've played it with an artist. He couldn't even draw a nose and chin in the 20 seconds he had, so his artistic standards took a dramatic tumble. If my spirits need a boost, I play this game. Buy it.  You'll love it

This game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it.  His little sister, who is two, also loves this game.  This game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues.  It is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept.  There are no complex rules to learn, so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game.  As each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match.  Best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the TV turned off

We recently played BONKERS at our game club. As we read the instructions we were hoping going BONKERS would be fun and it was. BONKERS is a game based on asking players questions.  The questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions, but instead word-based questions.  For instance, a question might ask you to "Come up with words that end in BELL".  During your turn you have 30 seconds to "Go Bonkers" trying to blurt out answers like: BARBELL; DUMBBELL; DOORBELL, COWBELL etc.  Your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card.   For every answer you hit, you win scoring chips. That was just one category of questions called ADD ONS - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word.  The other categories are:  WHAT THE BLANK - where you find words to complete the blank;  RHYME TIME - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card; and LETTER PERFECT - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters.  The game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in.  At the beginning of the round, one player (the Card Reader) peeks at the Question and Answers on Game Card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth.  So, in the example above, the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer COWBELL, four chips to BARBELL, three chips to DUMBELL and two chips to DOORBELL.  This is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer "A"; "B", "C" or "D".  The object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer.  This is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card, the Card Reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the Board.   However, if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card, they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided.  I really like the strategy part of the game, it adds a good deal of spice.  BONKERS provided for an entertaining evening.  We will play again!

I love this playpen!! Durable plastic, can be extended to larger size (or shortened if going someplace that is not as large). Only problem is that my baby loves to "wander." She is not thrilled when Mommy "cages" her up in order to protect her while I make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary. Crib toys can be safely attached on the sides (did that with her Aquarium toy, which she loves and it soothes her). Occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her. I just put her other toys in for her to play with

I bought this mostly for the container.  I had individual play-doh products, like the barber set that came in it's own box.  I'm able to put ALL play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot.  No more boxes and sorting.  I even still have space for more things like different colors and everything.  My daughter loves the variety of the toys and I love the convenience.  I'm going to buy it for presents for other families I know!

These dominos are great for the hello kitty lover.  My six year old loves them.  Don't be fooled by the picture though, the tin is not full.  If you ask me, there are not enough of them in there.  The tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full.  I would have rated it five stars if it had been full

We use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children. It's intended for children a little older, and I can see why, as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps. However, my 2-year-old can use it by herself, and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys. I had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old, but when doing so, it also allowed him to color. I would recommend it, especially for children 3 and up.

I'm not one for guns in my household, but my potty-training son really wanted this blaster gun. He's a total Star Wars fan (like his father) and I told him that he could have it if he said good-bye to diapers. He did. So we ordered it and waited for the UPS man to come. He was so excited when it was delivered. He thought the UPS man was so cool for giving that to him! Anyways, there is so much detail on this blaster gun. The sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red. My son loves the sight scope too! Big hit in our household!!!

I have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. Maybe so but, it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds! Those "in between stages" kids who want to have a small table of their own but, need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. My son (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table. It is very sturdy! The small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time. The surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures. The unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space. My son had outgrown 2 "child size" table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for "Kids" and it has been a big hit at our home. Guess who's getting the matching Lifestyle kitchen for Christmas

The only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug..

Other than that, this toy is simply adorable , the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable.. and the sounds it makes are truly neat. My daughter got this over a year ago, (she is 7 now) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs.

Ever since my son was 10 months old he just HAD to check out the vacuum whenever it was out. So we decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday. Since we use a canister vacuum I wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well, and this was pretty much the only one out there.

He just LOVES it, and since he is under 3, (the recommended age), I took the long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size. (the head fits fine straight onto the hose.) He knows how to turn it on & off, but mostly likes dragging it around. He also likes taking the two attachments out. And I love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it EVERYWHERE. And that can be a pain- (to the car, in the highchair, on the changing table, etc.) so I've had to hide it sometimes. :) But I am very happy with this vacuum

I love this motorcycle and it is a "no-duh" that it doesn't run on fuel.  Really...think...what fuel are you going to use.  Plus, fuel is hazardous to children and a company wouldn't threaten the lives of innocent children!  That's my OPINION

My 9 year old son loves Dragon Mountain.  He wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's typically very good at assembling most other toys.  It took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together

We are loving this set!  Very cool dragons, a fun environment for characters to explore and fight in.  Extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering cauldron, tramcar on sloped tracks, erupting mountain top, opening dragon mouth, flapping dragon wings, firing cannon.

A little challenging to build, but the instructions are fairly clear.  Assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours.

A few sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to put back together.  So far no pieces have broken.

Most important, this is a lot of fun to play with.  Over the past two days, our set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl.  A great toy for two kids to play with together, and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily playing by himself.

We wouldn't have paid the full retail price for this, but at $35 (Amazon discounted price), I think this is appropriate value.

These 'Cars' characters are all quality die-cast replicas that kids young and not so young can enjoy. The kids love playing with them and so far, our 'cast members' are still intact.
But they do look so good you might want to put one on your desk...

The details: painless shopping and quick shipping, as usual on Amazon

I first purchased the Winnie the Pooh Soft 'n Silly Tigger for my son when he was 4 months old.  He is now 14 months and LOVES his Tigger.  We now have 2 Tiggers, one as a back up, and he carries them everywhere he goes.  It's a great toy for young children to sleep with, being soft and cuddly.  Tigger has been a great comfort for my son and I don't know what I would have done with out them!

I wasn't so sure if he was ready for the puzzle at the age of 3, but four months after his birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces together. He is now 3.5 yrs. and knows how to complete it all by himself within less than 10min. I give ten stars

Previous reviews listed the lack of volume control as a negative point. In a panic I ran to check the three I have purchased for Christmas gifts 2002. ALL three have volume controls now! Don't let reviews on a previous model keep you from purchasing these products. Friends have these and my girls begged for their own. As a home-schooling mom I prefer to buy toys that are both fun and educational - Leap Frog is my best source

The game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults.  This makes it great game for the whole family to play together.   The images from the &quot;I Spy&quot; book illustrations are bright and  creative.  They don't match exactly- for instance, there might be two  images of cats, but borrowed from different photographs in the I Spy books.   So there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up.  This is a much  more attractive memory game than most, and would make an ideal gift for a  child or family

I just purchased this redesigned AT-ST from a local retail store. For the basic price of $20 for 244 pieces, this set is well worth the price.

I purchased the original AT-ST years ago and this model far surpasses that one in all ways. It's larger, much more stable, and has a unique pivoting mechanism which rotates the cab. It was very difficult to get the original AT-ST to stand upright without falling over; the 7657 is extremely stable.

The original AT-ST had Chewbacca at the controls which was pretty cool. However, not as cool as the AT-ST driver that has a new helmet and blaster. The only drawback is that his minifig head is flesh colored instead of traditional LEGO yellow.

It took about 20 minutes to put the model together. It wasn't very challenging but interesting to see how the rotating mechanism was put together.

I would highly recommend purchasing this set. For the low price of $20 for such a detailed and complete set, it's well worth the price. You won't be disappointed

I bought this toy because Amamzon's price was a great bargin compared to other stores.  I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way.  There is a lot more room for more logs.  115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front.  I ended up buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence

I was very happy with the Lincoln Logs I ordered for my three year old grandson. He has been enjoying them. They seem to be more complicated than they were when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to it. Then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a western building. My grandson has still been able to build something that he likes. Thank you for making it available

I recently bought this Read With Me DVD System after much hesitation from other reviews. It was on sale at Toy r' Us for $18 so I decided that I would go ahead and try it. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited until my daughter went to bed to program it.  To be honest, it took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it. The system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and I have a Pioneer DVD player that is over 5 years old. The only thing I would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to lay the DVD control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the eye on the Read with Me DVD system.  My daughter absolutely loved it! The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a few more DVD available in stores.

Ok so my son got it for christmas and here it is june and i just hooked it up. it took me all of 5 mintutes not even that to program it. the first try #4 wouldnt take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so that the "eyes" were right on top of each other. and it took straight away.

Its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old got bored. my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger choice of games. they are so similar that my 4 year old changes games quite a bit.

i am actually having trouble finding games for it now.

its great and if they are going to be in front of the TV might as well be learning. he also hase VSMILE which is a little bit better if you can afford the 60$ for the game unit and 20$ for the games. (grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games) so it wasnt bad for us.

read with me DVD is good though, i really enjoy playing it and listening to the stories

My children are 7, 5 and 20 months, and they all love it.  The baby is especially fascinated by it and was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers coached her a bit.  The humming sound is much less annoying the many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic noises

my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow!

If you love the unpredictable, then Catch 22 is for you.  This game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens.  Just when I thought I was about to win the game, my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens.  Boy, that did not make me happy at all.  The key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely.  The cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money.  Once you use the cubes, you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect blocker' square.  You can collect any blocker cube placed on the board, including your opponent's cubes.  I made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents. We were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long.  I highly recommend it, but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt!

I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen.  It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful.  It also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast.

I purchased this item for my 4 years old neice. She is Dora crazy as my 6 year old was at 2 and 3 years old. My daughter has the older version and she still plays with it. It's her house for her and her dolls. My neice is also enjoying her Dora house. Great gift. It does not  take up too much space. You can slide it under a bed, behind a couch etc. Dora house is great!

My 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents. So we went and bought this toy at Target (and paid 30.09 for it) He loves it... his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time. My only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries??? What are those??

Many people are not time oriented.  I have used this both in the classroom and at home.  It allows the children a visual clue to how much time has gone past.  I tell them they have 30 minutes to complete something.  I set green for 20, yellow for 7, and red for 3.  I don't have to say anything else.  This eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next lesson

My three year old takes a "rest" instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity.  He can't tell time, so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over.  In order to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up.  It works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up.  He understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. No more "is it time yet?".  I get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!

We wanted this little doll for our own "Little Ariel". She is perfect for the bath tub! She comes with her own float, wand with bath tints, and swim coverup!! Her bright red hair is put in little pig tails with bows and she has a baby powder fresh scent (which we were not expecting- my husband is not to found of that). We are very pleased and hope that this company continues to make baby princess items!!!

I love it! it's really light weight and portble.  The batteries do go dead without the charger and the PVDs should have more then 30 minutes-60minutes.  I like this video now alot.  Calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it's wonderful.  I hope you buy it!

We all LOVE this toy.  What I like about it, is that it's easy to use, even for my almost three yr old, it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious, it's sturdy, (Will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard) it LOOKS good, not cheap, and it's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes.

This has been THE big hit this Christmas.  Even more so than Tekno Puppy

My 11 yr old son got these Moon Shoes at Christmas and he plays with them a lot.  He has ADHD and Sensory Integrative Dysfunction, and the bouncing really soothes him and gets him refocused.  I don't think he ever expected to bounce very high; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he gets.  When he wants to play with them in the house, I send him downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and tear on my hardwoods.

The downside for us has been that the bands have started snapping very frequently.  At the rate he's going, he'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play with the toy.  So if anyone hears of a way to get more bands, please speak up

My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships.  This one is fully assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy.  The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate.  The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures.  My son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied for hours.  The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including the sails.  I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles.  I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects

This review is not about the toy, but about the service you can expect to receive from Amazon.com.  If you are buying this as a gift, only do so if you have months to wait, even if the item is listed as available.  Amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items, and then days later, inform you of a delay in shipping, and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery.  Despite the site's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered in 3-5 days.  Mind you, they're sending it via UPS or American Home....
Honestly, there are other retailers out there who are more reliable than Amazon.com and I strongly recommend using them - unless you're okay disappointing the little girl in your life.  I know I hate having to tell my neice that the gift I promised her still won't be there - even though her birthday has passed, by almost a week at this poin

My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing.  After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine.  She has learned how to button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book.  Also, I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible.  I have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it

Our whole family loves this game.  I like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover.  I also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice.  The construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy.  We added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better

These days, classic game shows aren't really as popular as reality shows like Survivor and American Idol. However, with the surprise Summer show, Game Show Marathon in CBS, many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life, like Press Your Luck, Match Game, and Card Sharks. Another classic which was revised, Let's Make A Deal. With Monty Hall's benchmark into pop culture revisted, many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again. Thankfully, those who easily own DVD actually don't have to wait for the show to return. They can just trade in the comforts of their own living room.

The Let's Make A Deal DVD game, recaptures the classic trading that Monty Hall made popular from the 70's and 80's into a great fun game. In this game, Monty Hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from Datsun, and Cadillac, to trips and fur coats from Dicker & Dicker of Beverly Hills. On top of that, there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash. For example, if you have a pair of scissors, Monty will give you $700. Also, there are the classic booby prizes, Zonks!!! Although they are fun to receive, you get absolutely nothing to show for it. There is also the anticipation of getting the Big Deal for big bucks. Unlike DVD editions of shows like Family Feud and The Price Is Right, the game really delivers a great job from Monty, and each of the great concepts from the classic game show. The mastering really thrives with classic clips of Carol Merill and Deal's announcer Jay Stewart on each of the prizes.

Although I just wish there could've been more games to play, I am absolutely impressed with the way Let's Make A Deal was put into a DVD game. If you haven't seen this classic game show, Monty Hall hosted, you have to buy this great game. I absolutely recommend this, and that is definitely not a zonk!

Price: B 1/2-

DVD Mastering: A-

Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+

Overall: B

I bought my seven and ten year old daughters moon shoes for christmas.  I had read all the reviews, so I immediately instructed the girls to always wear their bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes.

Yes, they can be dangerous, but with a few precautions, I think the kids will have more fun, be safer, and the parents will have peace of mind.

1. Don't let the kids start jumping right away, hold their hand or have them put their hand on your shoulder as they practice walking in them.

2.  Once they've achieved the ability to balance, have them practice bouncing in place just a little bit.  This will help them learn to balance as they move and learn how the moon shoes respond to the way they move.

3. Set ground rules, no bouncing when there is a lot of debris around, no bouncing while holding objects, always wear helmet, no bouncing near each other, and if you feel or hear any of the rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately and take off the shoes.

My kids spent the first half hour/45 minutes getting use to their moon shoes.  They now can bounce around with stability and confidence

both of my kids have a LeapPad and several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together.  It's durable and kid friendly--so they can keep track of their cartridges and books ... and it's great b/c they can just grab it and go which makes it nice for travel too

We bought the LeapPad Plus for our 4 year old for Christmas and 4 books to go along with it.  Then I realized we had no where to put it, we also bought the Littletouch leadpad for our 1 year old and a bunch of books.  Yesterday we went and bought this and the carry case for our little one's littletouch.  Great space saver.  It is made very well too.  Our daughter calls it her briefcase.  It fits everything perfectly

This movie teaches the basic ballet steps with the use of a mat.  Although it is a little slow in the beginning, once the dancing starts my daughter is hooked.  We started with with a VHS and had to buy a dvd because we played the video so much.

My grandparents bought me this for Christmas and I really love it! The doll is absolutely breathtaking, and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights. Her eyes are a deep blue green color, and she is very pretty overall. The closet she comes with is very cute, and I can put Barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers! There is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories, I love this toy

My son got this game as a gift.  I brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day.  The kids love this game and request it over and over.  Many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes.  It is a great vocabulary builder.  I also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them.  I use these when we are studying parts of speech --  they have to come up with a noun (adjective, verb, etc) that begins with that letter.  This is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting

My son loves to not only put together the "proper" dinosaurs, but make up his own creatures as well.  A fun way for dinosaur loving kids to engage in some creative "think outside the box" play

The little mermaid pop-up castle was sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $34.99.  I found it on Amazon for $26.47 and free shipping!
My daugher, 3 yrs old, just loves it.  The accessories are very tiny, like the tea pot and tea cups.  Tiny like your pinky fingernail.
We all love it! Easy to put together, but I think it folds up, I don't know how though

We bought this pool toy for our daughter, and she was thrilled!!! But after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull. Good luck staying on the silly thing. Now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it. My husband and I cannot stay on this thing either. Every now and then we bail on with sheer determination, only to be off in a matter of seconds

I have been having such a good time with this marshmellow shooter! I recommend it to anyone. Plus you can aim at someone and they can eat what the ammo! Thinking of giving these to me employees as Christmas gifts!

The remote on this car has nice big buttons that are easy for my two year old to use.  One button makes the car go forward and one turns it around.  The third just makes reving engine & squealing tire sounds. Not very realistic but convincing enough for a toddler.  This car has been tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great.  It is a very durable toy that is simple to use.  It is a great first remote control car.

This doll is absolutely breathtaking.  I bought her for my "gift closet", but I think I'll keep her for myself!
The price was only $5.29 during the special Toys R Us sale, plus free shipping.  Couldn't ask for a better deal or a prettier collectible doll

<review_text>
We learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school.  I was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood, so totally enraptured these little kids!
Kapla, are 'blocks' that are all exactly the same size.  At first glance, they seem boring.  But once you start playing with them, they are so much more.  They can be made into all kinds of structures, and can even be raised higher than one can reach, without falling!!
When our 'surprise blessing' turned 2, I pulled them out for him.  He enjoyed them (though at 3 he likes them much more), but what surprised me is that my older two (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!!  In fact, we ALL do!!
I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these, but they are MORE than worth it!

My daughter thinks these are the most adorable Fairies.  They adorn every possible accessory she and her friends can attach them to.  You never know who will have which charms as they are always swapping them.  I would say that you get an amazing bang for your buck with these.  They are the "in" thing right now with her 4th grade friends

This thing is great. Anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off. It will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them...funny funny funny!!!! You can use fairly light objects, you can use trip cords, and you can use trip cord like devices too, and probably much more that I have never thought of... Good luck, good fun, and good hunting!

I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, he was 8 months old. This has been the best learning toy for him, along with entertainment. He has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon. It has also helped him in walking. It is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy, he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it. I would actually buy one more for him to have at home with Mom and Dad. This is well worth the money

We love this game. It seems to be the most fun with 5 or 6 people, although my husband and I also enjoyed the 2-person version.
We do not usually use the board. We just use a scorepad to keep track of points.
Once you catch on to the game, it's not too hard to come up with answers.
Highly recommended

I received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  The price is great right now, especially with free shipping.
She loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories.  More than worth the low price...I'm going to stock up on a few more for misc. gifts.  The package is large and comes with a lot of accessories

Unavailable for some time, the Sky High Suspension Bridge is back.  Once you have the ramps to get the track up there, it really stands out as a part of the railroad.

Assembly was required but routine; the directions were quite adequate.  There are no stickers to wiggle into place

I've had this high chair for a year now, and I love it.  My daughter plays with it every day, and it's worn great.  It still looks as good as the day we put it together.  I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable.  The material has held up great and still looks perfect.  The wood is sturdy, with no cracks.  It fits all my daughter's dolls, including her large Cabbage Patch doll.  If I were going to change anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs).  For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes they slip down and out.  It's not a big problem, though.  Our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and feel the same way about it.  We love the Badger Basket product line!  I highly recommend this product

Another nice product from PlayDough.
Worth the ten bucks or so..  We just bought this from
Amazon.  This would make a cute birthday present for a young child, say 2 to 8?  Hard to give an age as I myself like to sit with my son and play!
Enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage.  I would buy this again as a gift

I bought my Harvey toy a while ago, and I was quite pleased. It's actually very durable, like everyone else has said. The crane doesn't break off, no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it. I think the only way to break it off is via steam roller.

Anyway, highly recommended for any Thomas collector

Being the first Ravensburger puzzle I have ever owned, it is without a doubt the best quality and the best detailed puzzle I have ever worked with.

The quality of the product is shown throughout, from the sturdy container, practically sediment free packaging, the exact cuttings of the each puzzle piece (not a single one was still attached to another puzzle piece and there were only one or two frayed cut spots in the whole set), and the high quality graphic printing.

The puzzle itself is made difficult primarily by the use of similar colors throughout.  The puzzle pieces are otherwise the standard cut type.

The resulting artwork is something that we've decided to actually frame and hang in my office, which we have never done over the years (puzzles can be very calming to work on after a long week of long and stressful work hours - especially when working on them with others).  The puzzle cuts are so well done that it is not entirely easy for someone to tell that it is a puzzle from general glancing unless they get up close (within 2 feet) and look at the detail.

I will definitely buy more Ravensburger puzzles and hope that they come out with even more puzzles of this type (old world maps) and same quality

An excellent project for your child's school report.  We purchased the Velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect. After opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds, instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit. We experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! We buried these edible bones in ground up Oreo Cookies.  What a thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils!  We can't wait to purchase other kits in the Eyewitness series

When the Toa and all the first Bionicles came out, it was very simple and straigthforward. Bad guys were different from the Toa and everyone knew they were bad. Now, with the Pirahka, we have villians claiming to be Toa! And the matoran believe them!

One of the things I really love about Zaktan is his weapon. It looks really cool and can change. Also, the little ball launcher (I forget what it's called) is a lot of fun (I shot my brother with it X3) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome! Though the rubber part is sligthy annoying, it doesn't really get in the way

As a brilliant, but ruthless leader of the Piraka, Zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure, the mask of life! All the Piraka have two tools. Yes, 2. Each one has a Zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot, but in real life they would be the size of basketballs. Zaktan's three-pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal. Nothing will get in his way, or it will be severely punished................

I think this toy is just too cute.  It is a bit pricey though.  I would not suggest you purchase this toy for a young toddler...maybe a 2 1/2 to 3 year old.  My daughter likes throwing it on the ground and screaming with delight (she is one and a half).  She really likes it and carries it around the house.  She is a little too young to respect it properly and I fear it may not last long.  It is really cute if you have real stainless steal appliances in your home.  I bought this because my daughter has taken a keen interest in my microwave and I have trouble keeping her away from it.  This toy has solved that problem.  One minus is that it came with no instructions on how to get the table to rotate.  You have to play with the buttons a little and then you will see how it operates.  My daughter can not systematically make the turn table rotate...for her it happens randomly.  She enjoys opening the doors, pushing the buttons, seeing the light come on and hiding her real dinner in there (so parents beware!).  Someone suggested it is a tiny unit...and so it is, but all the other toy microwaves I looked at were very similar in size

I bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old.  It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle.  I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play.  This doll is also washable, a big plus.  The hair is soft and very brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly.  A little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for many years.

we saw this online and really wanted it, but decided to wait because of the reviews. well today we went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount prices, and it was only 10.00 my son has already ridden the heck out of it with no problems, and he loves it. we havent had to replace a fuse and it just the right size for my 1 and a half year old. its a really great little bike, but for the workmanship of it, i definitly wouldnt pay 50 dollars for it, maybe 30-35 most. we just got blessed with a really great deal:) so if ya want this for your kids, its great for the smaller rider, and just the right speed for him to control. hope this helps someone:

I've been thrilled with the car so far.  Super fast, and super cheap at this price.  It could be a little more responsive when turning, but otherwise great.  Lasted about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9.6v pack by newbright.  As other person said, works better on packed surfaces vs loose dirt and grass.  I bought it to bring back memories of my old Tyco turbo hopper from childhood...and it did a great job at that.

We purchased a starter piece set for my girl when she was 3 years old. She absolutely loved it because it was easy to use and build. She had a hard time with the legos type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them apart. We then expanded to this 35 piece and she is able to be even more creative. It is an excellent lerning toy. not as simple as it seems

This doll rocks! I love her hair, it's a dark reddish color and it's curled into seperate locks. And her dress is gorgeous! It's a powder pink color with long sleeves, and at the hands it has a big ball of white feathers. The necklece she has is very pretty, and so is her crown. Shes quite durable, and would make a great addition to any collection or toy chest

My daughter is one and a half, and she's had these blocks for about a year now, but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures.  Some pictures are a little obscure, but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered.  I'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are, and how well they are holding up.  I feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters, both in upper and lower case.  My only problem is with the tray.  It only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level).  I also don't like its sharp edges.  My daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around.  Now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin

Murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels. He was brought to the Island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line. As shy as he is strong, Murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet.

This wooden train is a 2 piece set, joined with magnets. My son loves playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks. Very sturdy construction, and a great addition to the Thomas line

This action figure is sitting on my desk at home. He's my little computer buddy. It's really not bad at all, although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move very much. When I'm writing, and I get to a point where I need to back off a bit, I pick him up and change the pose, or threaten my daughter with the masamune, or she and I set him up for a couple of humourous pics. It's great.

All hail Sephi!!  (and you can just hear it, Why the heck are you calling me that?   Well, why not?  It's weird and it's not right!  But, Sephi....)

Hahahaha. Can't wait to get Cloud too. Then things in my house will be interesting

The "Shout About" line of DVD games are a great way of getting people together.
We play teams (at least 3-5 people on each) and it is always a noisy and fun crowd.

This is a fabulous little Brio bridge.  My kids (6, 3 & 2 yrs) all love this as part of their train track.  It is a sturdy piece which gets used daily.  My kids love that they can drive the train onto the bridge and then push the button that collapses the bridge and have the train (mostly this is Diesel 10) fall down.  It's a reenactment of the viaduct scene from Thomas and the Magic Railroad movie

I probably play over a hundred games of Solitaire a night.  I have a hard time sleeping but this game, after playing as many as I do, makes me go to sleep.  I haven't read a book in over two months which to me is remarkable because I have read at night ever since Junior High.  I am now 62 and playing Solitaire.  Thank goodness for it

This is a great puppet theater, sound stage, restaurant, play house, etc...  My daughter was 4 when she received this from Santa.  He only wished he had found it sooner!  My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with her younger sister.  Many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater.  We especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children.  All the others we researched were too small for our needs.  The colors are so vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company.  All the kids gravitate towards it

I love this puzzle! It is fun and challenging. I believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge. However I find that there is one problem with it. THERE ARE NO DIMENSIONS TO TELL YOU HOW BIG THE PUZZLE IS AFTER YOU PUT IT TOGRTHER!!! I would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box. I am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle. If you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle I would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection

I understand the people who install car seats who feel this item isn't needed and distrust its lack of crash testing, but my infant car seats are hand-me-downs without LATCH.  My car has LATCH, but does not seem to have the kind of seat belts that stay tight.  My car seat doesn't just get a little loose... you can move it 4 or 5 inches side to side if you try.  It may be that a car seat tech could train me to do a better job with the locking clip, but I can't get it to stop this.  And one of the seats was given to me without a locking clip at all.  I have no problem tightening the seat belt enough - it just won't stay that way.

This product allows me to tighten the car seat enough to meet the "one inch" spec.  Nothing else has.  So it definitely adds to my baby's safety.

Finally- to the car seat techs- with the number of these that have been sold, it doesn't appear that anyone has come forward to say that it failed in a crash.  Just because it hasn't been crash-tested does not mean it is unsafe.  And there is absolutely nothing wrong with aftermarket goods as a rule, tho manufacturers will ALWAYS tell you otherwise

I purchased this item when my daughter was one year old, and it was amazing!  My daughter was always a good sleeper, but when she began teething at around 9-10 months old, she began refusing to stay in her crib each night.  I was out of ideas, and my husband and I had tried just about every method we read about without success. Finally, I found the Tomy Star Bright Light, and it was like a miracle worker!  The first night I used it, my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling.  Each night, her sleeping became better and better.  Now, we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls asleep.  It is a much better approach then allowing your child to "cry it out".  She actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep.

We bought this puzzle for my then 2 year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle (which is also amazing).  There are monkeys, tigers, butterflies, and numerous other jungle animals.  I had to look up several of the animals as I was not sure of what they were.  This was a good educational experience for both me and my son.  This puzzle is durable as are all of the M&D floor puzzles.  It has been stepped on and thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child.  I have had this puzzle for over a year, and it looks great.  I rotate this puzzle with the other Melissa and Doug floor puzzzles that we have.  I recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids.  They are a great opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words to children

I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter for xmas and she was extremely impressed along with myself.  It's exactly like the "real thing" just smaller! Very durable, colorful, and fun! It's great to use with the Zapf Creation dolls that tend to weigh more than a smaller baby doll b/c the car seat is so sturdy. Unlike most car seats this doesn't collapse and fold up whenever you actually try to carry it by the handle! It is definately worth the price

You might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 Optimus Prime toy (or wanted a trailer for the truck), but this is an updated version of the original character, as opposed to a remake, and is superior in many ways. It is durable, detailed, well-articulated, and fun, especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot. I'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike

This product is not the best ever created, as the Roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of Bratz dolls. She has huge black and red streaks in her hair, as well as an oddly-shaped head. However, one gets used to her and can even find her pretty. The stage itself is a great product, but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think. This playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular Rock Angelz microphone, as it is gray and of a different style. Also included is a faux-snakeskin chair, Roxxi, a guitar, and a few accessories, like bottled water and make up compacts. The stage itself is rather nice, and I strongly suggest the Instrumentz if you buy this. However, be warned that it is not the BEST of Bratz products, despite its appeal. It's rather nice, though. :

I love this nativity even though it I think it is pricey.  There are no other ones like it.  They are Fisher Price Little People so you know they will hold up forever!  There aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. Get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable. It is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year. I even take this to church when I teach my 3and4yr old class about Jesus birth.  They LOVE it

My 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy. It is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well. They love to pretend to be rock stars! My only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control.... so you only get one level...LOUD. I would recommend it for any child that likes to sing

Meygan is my favorite, but Yasmin is still beautiful. These dolls are gourgeous

I bought this play tent for my 15-month old daughter for Christmas.  She loves going through the curtain entrances and plays peek a boo through the little window.  She's a little rough on the door, not realizing the door opens outward.  But she's a little young still to understand the full extent of the play tent.  All in all, worth the money

Nuparu is SWEET! But, sadly, his skull does not glow in the dark. Nuparu has black/gray armor, a light up sword with a strobe effect, two claws, and a Zamor sphere launcher attached to his back. You must be careful with the zamor spheres, though, because they're easy to lose. Now I have Toa Matoro and Toa Nuparu! YOU HAVR TO BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bought Blue, Majenta and Periwinkle for my 2 youngest.  The kids love them!  I have been purchasing Ty products since their inception about 10 years age.  I am so glad the've branched into some characters my kids love: Blue's Clue's and Backyardigans.  Looking forward to more in the Blue's Clue's line!

Damn! I just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks.  At first I had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing, it's still mad tricking.  In other words, I've been trying pretty hard to break it.  For it's price, the yostick is incredible fun.  In an age of pricey video-games, $10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise, fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts.  A value-priced training tool, not a toy at all.  The movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls.  The ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground.  Looking forward to collecting other models. Enjoy It

My friends and I, all in college, are major movie buffs, so when another friend told me about the game, I was eager to try it.  Some parts are tough, but with the team setup of the game, it seems to even out.  Favourite rounds were Still Crazy: a round where scenes are built piece by piece, a word association round: 6 clues are provided and the idea is to name the movie, and the quotes round, of course!  The hardest rounds were the matching and the trivia rounds.  Still, we had great fun.  Its better if the teams are evenly matched, then its more fun.  The main objection I have is that in the 8 rounds, many of the movies are dated and overused.  There are great ones, though...Rain Man, Cast Away!!  Also, this game is linear in progression, there is no variation in the order of the questions.  Scoring uses the honour system.  There are 3 games, each lasting around 45 minutes at the very fastest, its the same as the cost of a regular DVD and is much more fun with lots of people.  I have bought this for several people and some of my friends have as well.  Recently I played a game where a 12 year old and an 82 year old were playing so don't worry about the age thing, both enjoyed it.  Really, I recommend it

I bought this for my son for Christmas, which at the time he was only 14 months old.  The age says from 18 months.  The problem is he can't hold the button down to make it go so I have to walk around the train and hold the button for him.  We had a playgroup over and there were kids that were over 2 years old and they couldn't hold the button down either.  Overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for him.

Also, this toy is cheaper at Toys-R-Us.  I got ours when it was on sale for $[...].  After Christmas they had them on sale half off for $[...]

This Angel is sure to be a gem in any collectors collection. She is elegant and graceful. Her gown in beautiful as well as her spiral curled hair. She is adorned in a golden head chain. She has a chain sash which is also part of her gown. At last she is given beautiful golden wings and holds a bouquet of flowers. This one will definately be worth the value in the years to come

As with all the leap frog products, this ones a lot of fun. Packed full of learning surprises. I have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it's 'work'. The Birthday Surprise is fun and full of rhyming words, that make little one want to learn. I have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating, because of the quality in all their products.
Learning last a lifetime, so get them started with fun friends from Leap Frog.

This case is nice and tough, it holds all the accessories for the FP3 player securely.  I gave it 4 stars because I think things like FP3 players need a home and it serves that purpose great.  It matches with the player and is built to withstand kids.  I did take a star off my rating because, as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by, it should really have a handle.  Little hands need something easy to hold on to, and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose I could see

My three children are huge fans of Melissa and Doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly.  Being an organization freak myself, I was in search of the perfect storage case.  Not only did it need to hold many puzzles, but it needed to be made well and look nice too.  Melissa and Doug to the rescue - once again!  We purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore.  You might find it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so I suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60 instead.  More for your money!  In our case, we own so many puzzles that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have

I bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib.  He moves around A LOT in his sleep so I wanted a safe first bed for him.  He absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before.  The only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high, so we just use the mattress for now. Eventually we'll put the box spring back in.

1. Tape as many Jenga sticks together with masking tape on one side to support a favorite picture that you would like to turn into a special puzzle.
2. Have your child find a any picture they would like to turn into a puzzle (even a favorite photo can work.)
3. Glue whole picture to opposite side of masked taped Jenga.
4. Shellac and allow to dry
5. Use excto knife and cut the picture apart.
6. Remove tape and voila`--your own hand-made puzzle!
Even toddlers can put a 5 piece puzzle of an animal or fruit together and they love creating their own puzzle! Enjoy! Aloha

I had searched in stores around me wanting to buy it but no one had it. Sure enough I found it on Amazon. It's a lot of fun to play with and he just loves to rock out with it. I definately recommend this toy

I purchased this Train Case for my son last Christmas, (age 6).  It is very sturdy, with handle.  I like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply/easily.  Those moms like myself, when your child has finished playing, there is now a place for them to put their trains in.  The 'metal' case is a great added bonus, the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case.  Next play time, the trains are all in one spot. Thomas, come up with a place like this for the track - I need it

I bought the Harry Potter Magic Puzzles for my nieces and I scored some major brownie points.  They loved this at first because it was about their hero, Harry Potter, however, they play with it for hours on end.  Putting the puzzles together is fun in itself, but then there are the cool magic tricks and the VERY COOL optical illusion using the spiral disk too.  This is great for any kid interested in magic, as well jigsaw puzzles and Harry!  A big thumbs up

Our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home.  True, the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there).  We've also needed lash the front piece on with some string (again, it's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box).  The simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason, it's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment.  It's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours), and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old.  It's gender neutral, forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs (repeatedly) without breaking, light enough to not squish whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery

I bought two of these trucks for my twin boys when they were 16 months old.  They loved it so much and the bubbles come out the front for added fun. The music and lots of buttons to push, a storage under the seat and a fire helmet makes this a fabulous toy. My boys are now 27 months and have not stopped playing with this truck!!  Its great, buy it, buy it!

My kids (4.5 and 1) love this car. The sounds it makes are great. They take turns riding on it and the other one pushing. It is quite durable and they play with it all the time. Only negative is that some of the stickers peeled off. Overall, it's a great toy and the kids play with it every day

He's into firetrucks and Mickey Mouse so you couldn't ask for a better toy.  It's small enough to ride around the house without running into everything, but also durable enough to play outside with. It's the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he's playing with at night (most days)

This is the Optimus Prime that should have been made 20 years age. It was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging. Finally nostalgia won out and I had to transform him. It was amazing. The transformation took time but it was worth the wait. I felt like a kid again. I am totally satified with this product.

theres a few things the are nice about this prime and things that arent

pros:extrem detail coloring is good megatron rifle is sweet mouth moves

cons:primes regular gun will barley fit in primes hands bit more platic then die cast a pain to transform pushing legs in most of all sound base sounds like a ultra magnus mixed with prime

I can find more cons then pros I would ONLY get this toy for some one 11 or older not somebody who goes all wild and takes there toys every where oh wait another PRO!:primes leg vents open when you stand him u

I just transformed it for the first time into a truck. It was challenging but doable. Probably one of the coolest toys ever, but I was an 80's child. As someone else mentioned, the grill in front does not quite align with the cab windows when it's all set, but other than that it's great. Tremendous amount of detail (moveable leg vents, head, mouth, individual fingers/thumb poseable, light behind Matrix, datacom interface, working shocks on the wheels, and accessories). It's quite tall and heavy for a toy- very impressive. If a piece snaps off from forcing it the wrong way, it is designed to snap back on. I never got to own a Transformer as a teen but my lost childhood is now officially redeemed. This will adorn my office cube as a conversation piece

The instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out. You had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down. Then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target. Otherwise I it is holding up great  so far!

I've been wanting this forever and when I got it,it was totally AWSOME!! First it comes with a really,really cool chair (that you are going to LOVE!),it also comes with a SWEET guitar with amp (FYI. the amp has some really cool stickers on it) and it also includes two (2) guitar magazines. I truly LOVE this piece mainly because I've always wanted an amp for my guitars. Oh,I HIGHLY,HIGHLY recommend this you'll LOVE it! Well hope this helps. :)

I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson. I knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it. It did not lose it's charm for 11 year old boys through the years. My grandson was thrilled with it as well. Just enough challenge to keep their interest

Our three Asian-American granddaughters got these today for Christmas and they love them! Ignore the 5-star reviews that trash these cute little dolls, then try to steer you to eBay for another doll. These are the genuine article and kids LOVE them, as they have for generations. Our thirty-plus daughter-in-law still has her original Cabbage Patch doll, and she still loves it, just as her daughters loved theirs today

The game is fun....we played it when we lost electricity during Hurricane Isabel and was kept entertained! I dont know if I would take everything in the game as seriously as everyone else is, writing bad reviews. If you look to a board game for "truth" in life, youre not going to get far! This game is fun and makes you think and re-think what you THINK you know! I suggest it for teens

My daughter received this toy for her fourth birthday.  She plays with it all the time!!!  It didn't come with any tapes and honestly she doesn't need them!  She spends quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide to change the sound of her voice.  It is so funny!  We all get a kick out of it.  There are several different sounds to choose from.  Even her two year old twin sisters get into the act.  They love it.
Love this toy.  It's extremely durable.  Would absolutely recommend this

I bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month's.  I did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the Loving Family Sweet Sound's house. At first I almost went with the My first doll house by Fisher Price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right.  This house the Sweet Sound's is a perfect size for her and I know she will get quite a few year's out of it.  Yes the Furniture is impossible to find.  After reading the review's I didn't look for it much knowing I would never find it.  I ended up buying her the Twin town's bathroom and a few pieces from the My first doll house by Fisher Price.  The pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces.  They work great with the doll's that come with it too.  I did also purchase one doll set from twin town house.  The house does make some sound's with just the pieces that come with it, they are cute and my daughter doesn't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture.  She's Happy with the way it is. I decided against the Twin Town because I agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room's were too tiny.  Yes you get more room's but my daughter I know would get so frusterated with alway's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room's.  This house has big room's.  It fold's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture.  We leave it open anyway's so that is not a big deal.  It was easy put together but the sticker's took about and hour to put on.  Also a note make sure and put the battery in BEFORE you fill it with furniture, I put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere.
  Also I didn't see any one mention the front door.  I am not really sure why but it doesn't open from the outside, only from the inside.  You can open it from the outside but you have to pull it very hard and really aren't supose to open it that way.  Why not be able to open it both way's???  I guess their thinking is so if you are moving it so the door doesn't swing open but they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it shut when you wanted.
  Also I am not sure what room is supose to be the bathroom.  I think it is either the bedroom or above that which I thought was the kid's playroom.  I ended up putting the bathroom in the right side of the bathroom.
All in all I think is is a great doll house and I would recommend it

This Emperor Penguin Puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old.  We almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal.  This penguin looks round and pregnant, but to my kid, this penguin is a perfect friend.  He has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys, but for some reason, this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination

I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies.  When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together.  I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work.  So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not.  I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well!  I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one).  Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off!  It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great!  I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller.  I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck

I just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than Thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive. they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom ) LOL can really make use of all the options. However, overall I really love this toy but yes I had to convert my office room into the Geotrax room. be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up. Its very hard though since it all is so coo

I was very pleased when this toy finally arrived.  The Blue Devil is removable and semi-posable (his arms move).  He is the same size as the Simpson figures from the Playmates line of toys, so I feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind.  The Homer donut-eating action doesn't always work correctly--the mouth and donuts aren't correctly synchronized, so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth--but that does not detract from the fun

I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed.

One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring.  I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games.  Too bad for them.  Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me

      This is a well thought of game.  A game where the players play along with the DVD as the Gatemaster gives you commands, rewards, or punishiments while they are playing the game.  Players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the DVD.  Six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces, as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up.  If neither player wins in 49 minutes, the Gate master has defeated you.  In the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun.  The board has six territories.  Each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys.  You can pick up a key by landing on the key space, having a card telling you to, gate master telling you to, or winning a duel.  A duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both.  There are two types of cards... TIME and FATE.  Land on a skull head and get a FATE card which allows you to do something in a certain situation.  A TIME card you get if you land on a clock.  A time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to. Sometimes the Gate master will give you the power to banish someone.  When there is reward, there is also punisment.  If you land on the cursed key, you have to pick it up and whenever you have it, you cannot win.  If you are landed into a black hole, you cannot participate until you are freed.  Also, you can lose keys.  During the game the Gate master says "Stop!" frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished.  All in all, it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money.

The 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family. but we soon got bored of the same video over and over. We could not believe it when we saw a new version of the game out, we rushed out to buy it and found this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the first they should have just released the first version of the game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money

This toy is wonderful for several reasons. For one thing, it's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need. It has very basic shape sorting (with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in), plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks.

The toy also helps teach colors and animals, and the locks develop fine motor skills even further.

Overall, this toy is very well made. It's real wood, dove tailed together. It could, of course, fall over, but if your child is the 18 months or older that is recommended for this toy, he or she probably isn't small enough for it to hurt. The locks on this toy are a little more chintzy. They wobble, which makes locking or unlocking some of them more difficult...But you could look at this as just another learning tool.

My biggest concern is that the blocks are relatively small; they could squeeze through a toilet paper tube. This means they are a potential choking hazard, so you'll want to supervise when your child uses this toy.

All that said, my 20 month old LOVES this toy and plays with it more than anything else she has

As a mother of 5, this toy has proven to be one of my favorites of all time.  My son received it for Christmas (at age 2 months) and it has been wonderful.  We place it in his bed at naps and at night, and he goes to sleep watching and listening to it.  When he wakes up, it is there for him to play with.  As he has grown (he is now 7 months), he has become increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the toy, and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with teething.  I have been impressed with the sound quality (it is not annoying like most musical children's toys) and I will be anxious to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level.  LOVE THIS TOY!

I bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it! The music quality is great and she really enjoys the lights. It has a very sweet face and she smiles and talks to it a lot. I got it on clearance which is good because as cute as it is, I don't think it is worth the original price. I would definately recommend it if you can get it on sale

This is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year. If you can find it ANYWHERE I would highly recommend it. It plays pre-programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback. The microphone is nice for aspiring American Idols (like my daughter!) and it really is pretty. We did lose the dancing Cinderella with Prince Charming, but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played. It also does a pretty light show. I cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls

I got this yesterday for my daughters (3 & 6 years old), and they like it very much...let's see how long that lasts.
The space is kind of cramped, but both of them fit in there with a few dolls, so I wouldn't complain about that.  Setting it up was pretty easy, and although it has almost no stability (it gets toppled every couple of minutes or so), that doesn't seem to take away the fun from it.
However, there were a couple of surprises for me:

a)  The product I got is very different from the picture in the advertisement.  It is still shaped like a castle and has the Disney Princesses and all, but it is just different.  I am not complaining, my girls like it a lot.
b)  As I said before, setting it up was fairly easy (just keep your face away as you take it out of the box, for it will spring out on you VERY FAST), but, trying to disassemble it and putting it away is a completely different story.  For that, you have to remove 4 rods (which were not so easy to insert in the first place), and then, you have to fold the thing away twisting it in a way that only experienced snake handlers would be expected of being able to do so (I don't care how easy it should be according to the instructions).  I tried it for about 20 minutes until I gave up.  And, if you don't keep the box this thing came in, just forget about storing it folded, it would be like trying to keep a "Jack in the Box" compressed without the "Box".  Think about it.

So, if you don't mind adding this to the permanent decor of your house, go for it, your girls will probably like it.

My 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents. She loves the disney princesses and was ver excited. I was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down, she plays with it in her room almost everyday and I love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep. Overall we are very pleased with this tent, although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that I could play in there with her

I was disappointed when I opened the box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than I expected it to be. My friend's daughter has an almost identical tent which is much bigger. Apparently there are two different kinds, one made by Playhut and one made by The Disney Store

We received Boggle Jr as a gift at Christmas. My daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game. She is learning her words and is learning to spell. This is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words. I told my sister and she requested it for her son. He's a happy camper with the game, too

The Suduko Board Game is the perfect gift for the older kids on your lists.  It is well made and can be played by one or two so they can use it alone or with friends.  Since it is wood it will last a long time whether it is being played by middle schoolers or college kids. Also, I paid $17.99 for this and have not found it anywhere near this price.  It is usually $29.99 to $39.99 for the exact same game

This doll is so beautful. Back off everybody, I am the bratz number 1 fan with over 120 of them! Seriously, and thats not all, I go on the website 4 hours a day, and am collecting bratz babyz and have many bratz furniture. Consider me the bratz expert.
OK so hi everybody! I'm here to give you some tips 'n' tricks as well as handy hints on this particular talking bratz doll, who is my fave character YASMIN!
This doll, for starters, is a mixture of diferent bratz collections.  She has a bratz princess T-Shirt, wildwest cowboy a-go-go boots, forever diamonds fur, Bratz Fabulous coat and Passion For Fashion miniskirt. I mean Whoa! If you wanted to buy any of those dolls listed above, just get this! She is a mixture of all!
Secondly, she talks! Which is great. She is also interactive, saying over 125 phrases. If you place her with other talking bratz dolls, she will get excited and start to have a conversation! She can also talk to you if you are lonely. She has a sensor so she 'knows' what yor saying and can give a correct answer!
Also, she'll be your best friend at nightime. her lips light up while she speaks! The base at the bottom can be removed so she can be like a regular bratz doll! If you, however, press the button on the base, her lips wll still light up as she speaks.
And at only $19.99 , parents, all of you parents out there, you don't know what your missing

My 6 year old loves this toy.  She made all 3 bears at one time.  My husband helped her.  They are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool, so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re-stuff them

We bought my son a couple of starfighters, the tri-fighter, the AT-RT, and the wheel bike.  He loves the starfighters and likes the AT-RT a little.  He rarely plays with the wheel bike.  I think the starfighters are just simpler, sturdier, and easier to play with.  The wheel bike (and to a smaller extent the AT-RT) are more complicated, and thus less fun for a 5-year old.

We run around having mock dog-fights with the starfighters, but poor old General Grievous sits in the toy box.

Overall, probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff, but not all that fun for the younger guys

These blocks are so great! They've gone through their different stages of growth. They learned to reach for them, peek inside, grasp them, toss them around and now stacking them to make towers. My triplets are 20 mos and have had them for about a year. Love them all

All of the peek a blocks are fun. Although each set has a different 'theme' they are very similar and enjoyable to play with.

These blocks are great fun. Each block has something interesting inside it. In our house these have been played with by boys and pretty roughly at times. The windows to see inside are still clear and not one of these blocks have broken. So I would say they are sturdy and hold up well to normal play.

On the ends of each block is a texture. Within each block is something interesting. And many blocks have an activity associated with it- push a button to make a noise, twist a knob to make something turn around etc.

The one thing I would warn is that these blocks do not stack well, particularly in tall towers. So if you are thinking of buying these for tower building, I'd consider a different set of blocks. Otherwise, these are excellent toys.

They provide a basis for communication and vocubulary building with your child. They are sturdy and encourage language, eye hand coordination and so on.

If you enjoy toys that are fairly quiet, do more than have a push button to make a noise, foster independent creative play and exploration of the world this is an excellent toy.

Enjoy.

My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop.

For children who don't have a hard time in school, this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an adapter.

HE HAS TWO NOW, BUT LET ME TELL YOU HE CAN TELL THEM APART!!!  THE TAG ON HIS &quot;FIRST&quot; ONE IS SLIGHTLY MORE WORN AFTER COUNTLESS WASHINGS AND HE LIKES THAT ONE BEST.  THE &quot;OTHER ONE POOH BEAR&quot; AS HE CALLS IT, WORKS ONLY IN EMERGENCIES.  MY 9 MO. OLD DAUGHTER IS GETTING THE PIGLET SINCE SHE LOVES THE POOH TOO BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF MY SON GIVING ONE UP.  BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In Boggle, players compete against one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid.

The game develops pattern recognition skills, and because most possible words are only three or four letters long, astute younger players can play adults without too much of s handicap.

Tactics learned playing Boggle translate well into success at Scrabble and other word games, while the clock management skills help with chess and test taking.

Boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game, though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to avoid losing the letter cubes. As an added plus, the game can be played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value.

If you enjoy Boggle, you might want to seek out Big Boggle, which uses a 5-by-5 grid (56% more cubes). Words and time limit are both longer.

I received this Ty pig as a baby shower gift. My son "discovered" it when he was 18 months old and it's his dearest companion besides his "night-night." Piggy must go for car rides, eat with him, get jammies on and go to the Dr. to have his temperature checked. We love Piggy because when he's covered with milky Cheerios, we can just throw him in the washer and dryer. He's good as new in about an hour. Who wouldn't love that? It's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites. We love it and my son loves it. Now we ordered a spare Piggy so that there is a Piggy substitute when Piggy is bathing. Enjoy your toddler

I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under $20.00.

I think this a great item for a child over 3 1/2.  Since there are 4 puzzles in one box, our son, who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate.  They are symbol coded on the back, so I think once he gets older it will get easier.  He loves the pictures and I love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning.
Highly recommnde

this pony has proved (along with the Princess Promenade) to be one of the most popular of the my little pony's we have bought. It comes with a pink skirt, a pink crown and high heel shoes. The most popular item was the dressing table with revolving mirror and after several months it still hasn't broken despite harsh treatemnt. The pony is white with silver strands through the mane and tail. It was very pretty but the rough treatment really does make the mane matted very quickly. Also, think about getting white pony's very seriously for younger children, While the coloured ones can be drawn on with pen and the stains wiped off and at least partly concealed - on white ponys it is impossible to hide. For the younger ones (3 year olds) it is hard to get them not to at first. Desert Rose was very pretty but is now a bit stained and sorry looking. Never the less she is integral in my children's games still which is nice. One of the more popular ponies we have bought. Generally very hard wearing, including the accessories, the only item which has been broken is the crown which didn't last - it was too thin and got badly bent early on

My son received this toy for his first birthday!  I will be purchasing it as gifts for all my friends!!  He LOVES pushing the button and listening the the music.  I was wondering if he would be able to figure out the gears, but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the gears off and put them back on.  He also enjoys stacking the gears up and watching them go around!  I like that it has a handle so he can carry it around with him.  It keeps him involved for up to 20 minutes at a time!
It is very durable as he carries it around, has chewed on the gears (which are made of strong plastic and cannot be marred by chewing on them).

My three year old also likes to play with it!  Her play is a little sofisticated with it as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where (as in, do they have to be next to the middle spinning one) placed to make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn.

My one wish is that Playskool would include a few extra gears.  We have them everyhwere in our house and cannot always find them all.  It would be great if they had a place where you could purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for stacking.

This is an awesome toy that the kids love, can learn from, and is very durable!  It is a must have!

We've had one in the house for a few years now. The kids (5 and 2-1/2) love it. It's soft, cuddly, and sized just right for them. It's been taken all over the place, has provided companionship for them on many a long trip (including two to South Korea), given comfort when they are sad, and been used for countless hours of make-believe. Its worth has been far more than what was paid for it

When I ironed my 14M son wanted to play with it. He helps with the house cleaning.  I bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch, sprays water and pretend buttons.  He loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet.  We "play" iron with the water when I have time. This is one toy that I can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time.

This is one of the few toys, it seems, which has remained fundamentally unchanged since we were children.  The push-stick is shaped a little differently (I remember a thin blue broom stick with an orange or red handle) but otherwise, it is the same.  No electronic sounds or flashing lights have been added - although you can get it that way, too, if you want.  Personally I think these things detract from the imagination building aspects of certain toys.  I'm not saying we have no talking or musical or flashing toys, but it dismays me when these things are added to the classics (think Little People farm etc).

What I love about this toy is it can be ANYTHING.  It's a sweeper!  It's a carpet cleaner!  It's a mop!  It never fails to crack me up when my son comes running after me with his corn popper when I am cleaning.  It's a lawnmower!  So many jobs around the house or yard can be copied with the corn popper.  And if mom or dad isn't up to much, it's still great fun to run around with which means exercise for the kiddies.  It's a solo toy and a playing-with-other-kids toy.  Any time we have other children over to play, the corn popper comes out as they chase each other about the house.

We got this toy when my son was 13 months.  He is now 3y4m and still playing with this toy.  I have seen 5 and 6 year olds still playing with the corn popper.  There are few toys that are so simple and yet offer so much fun.  Sturdy, too - very important as it's bound to be crashed into a few walls.  I can't think of another toy which will give you more bang for your buck - unless you count dirt and measuring spoons and all those other free things that kids so exasperatingly pick over the toys you paid good money for.

I am a little alarmed at the current PRICE listed for this toy, though.  You should not need to pay that much for it.  Occasionally this item becomes hard to find - especially at Christmas - but usually there are tons of them in the stores for around the cost of a President Hamilton.  Right now this is listed for twice that.

Some of them are even thinking about buying one. I love listening to music on my brand new bratz lips boombox. And this year at my birthday slumber party, I'm gonna play music all night.

Bought this game at Books a Million in North Carolina for a mere $10+tax. A very good deal! Although I don't keep up on a lot of contemporary literature, I was able to do pretty well. Within three hours I had all but one pie. One of the teammates did as well. The third of us wasn't as lucky, but it was a fun game nonetheless. As with all board games, the fun is in the company, not knowing all the answers. The questions were good, and yes - tough - but they were tough for all of us, not slanted towards one particular audience.

I would have given this 5 stars except that there really do need to be more question cards. But for $10, three adults had three hours of intelligent entertainment (we went through half of the cards). We got our money's worth

We live in Alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play.  We found them for purchase on Amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to Alaska.  Although we are part of the US and USPS ships for a reasonable price, we weren't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been.  UPS and FedEx rip off those of us in Alaska while USPS treats us just like everybody in the Lower-48.  Give us a USPS option

We purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size, meaning the food would be closer to "real" size rather than miniature. It was. We also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use. That remains to be seen, but the stuff is made well and I cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer. Nice texture, nice flexibility, pretty realistic looks. The child it was intended for (age 4 and a bit) plays happily with it, even the older boys (10 and 13) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it

I have two boys, 10 and 12.  The younger one bought a webkinz first and after seeing how much fun he had at the website, the older one asked for one for his birthday.  The website is very kid friendly.  You won't have to worry about what they will see on this website.  It is great fun, and even I play on it!  I highly recommend this for any age child

I purchased this expansion set, along with the Thomas and Friends Water Towr Figure 8 Set, for my 2 year old this past Christmas. The expansion set was an afterthought, prompted in no small part by the manufacturer's promotion running at the time (50% off this set with the purchase of a Figure 8 set).

With the conclusion of many initial hours of intense playtesting (an ongoing process, with no termination in sight), my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any but the most basic (read: boring) wooden railroad layout. This expansion pack comes with switch tracks, and allows little train engineers (and their dads) to reverse directions or explore different parts of the railway. In retrospect, I think that I would have been dissatisfied had I not purchased this set to complement the basic Figure 8 layout, promotional price or not.

As far as the quality, the Learning Curve wooden track is made from hardwood, and is more substantial than many other brands of compatible track (i.e. Maxim, First Learning, etc.). This is a consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart by him/herself to put away. We have already broken a couple of pieces of generic track this way, since the male end of the connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track.

Overall, we are quite satisfied with this set, and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment

But I like Sasha and Jade better. She's cute though. She has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute!

Her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design. Her skirt is a strange black, pink, and gold pattern. Her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow "stone" in the middle.

Her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design. Her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it. Her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them.

Thanks for reading my review! Hope you enjoy her

We bought this set for my seven year old boy and we were a bit dissapointed. There are better magic kits out there for the price for older children. (Look at the Marshal Broden Kits by Cadaco). If you have a young child is is four and five though this is a great set. The tricks are easy to work and they are big for small hands. Anyone who has any magic sets or tricks though will find this too simplistic and not as exciting as many of the other kits.

My 3 year old opened this for Christmas and loved it.  Who would have guessed that this little car would have been a bigger hit than a lot of the more expensive things he was given!  It doesn't get stuck on any surface that we've tried it on and drives right over things in its path, which my son thinks is REALLY COOL!  Great toy for a relatively inexpensive price

No bells, no whistles -- Just an action figure with its' own four-wheeler.  It can capture the mind of a car-obsessed 6 year old boy for an hour at a time at least :-)  Some of the objects that the action figure is supposed to hold don't stay in his hand very well, but oh well -- it seems that all my nephew wanted to do was crach the thing anyway!  And it takes that quite well.

More track is the first thing you're going to want to buy after your first GeoTrax train set.  It will seem like you never have enough straights and curves to bring the track design to reality.  The "switched" pieces work out better as the child gets older (3-4+)

I THINK THE HAIR MAY BE A BIT OVER DONE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS RIGHT ON. I LIKE THE MAKE-UP AND THE CLOTHES AND SHE DOES SEEM TO RESEMEBLE VERONICA FROM THE ARCHIE COMICS I REMEMBER READING AS A CHILD. I GIVE HER 4 & THREE-QUARTER STARS. (IT WOULD BE FIVE IF THE HAIR WERE BETTER.) SHE'S STILL A GREAT DOLL THOUGH. NEARLY PERFECT!!!!!

Easy to follow instructions for set-up and play, very intuitive.  The only thing I would suggest is to make sure the young folks have an 'elder' playing on their team, to have a shot at the questions on old people, events, etc.  If they're real sports history buffs, then it's not an issue

My son calls this a flute, and rather than argue, we let it go. But his little hands have a hard time holding it. (He's 4). Even I have trouble. I'm right-handed and the right-hand keys are on the bottom. I don't know if that's how real clarinets are, but it's awkward. Also, your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play, so that's also a little frustrating. But the sound is great and it's fun to play once you get the hang of it

Nursing Nana is a great gift. It is soft and cuddly, and the puppies attach with magnets, giving a realistic nursing "tug" as you attach and detach them. This would be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is still worth it because it is well-made

This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals.  The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos.  I got this for my nephew and he likes it.  It keeps him entertained.  One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality.  Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair.  I wish we could find good quality plush anymore.  I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have.  I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair.  So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive

 A retooled mold brings this 60s sci-fi kit back to the hands of today's kit builders!

 Not QUITE accurate to the sets & miniatures of the original show... the passenger compartment should have 2 more seats, the control yokes are not included with the pilot's console, plus the top dome is round instead of teardrop-shaped... but these are all true to the original Aurora model.

 Wouldn't take much to fix the mistakes, as there are plenty of references & replacement decal sheets out there... or just build it "as is" for nostalgia value

I started playing this game in it's original German version. Which, went through some revision as the expansion decks were put out. As a result, the english version may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion decks. Talk about a wonderful game to play for two people! It is absolutely well put together, though certainly different in playing than the boardgame version of Catan. It uses the same notions, but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game play itself. The expansion packs are absolutely great, and overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game. IT takes a couple of hours, and a signicant amount of table space. It travels well enough in it's box, but to actually play it you need time and lots of space.
I highly recommend it, especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that you can play that is fun, involving, and certainly full of strategy. This is one of the many wonderful games made by Klaus Teuber, and I hope he keeps coming up with winners

This is a great game for two players (and two players only).  The first one or two times I played, it was very, very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in.  However, once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you, games tend to take about an hour.  It's a fairly involved game, so you have to be in the mood for that.  There's a lot of strategy and many ways to win.  I greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games.  It might be daunting for a really casual gamer, though.  If you like it, there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original

I stumbled upon this game years ago, and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends, who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids' game.  This past year, I decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom.  I must say...WOW.  I allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom, and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the Frog Juice.  They would even play it over other outdoor games at recess.  Anytime you heard a "NOOOO!" in the room, you knew someone had pulled out the Witch Wash.  The kids LOVED it.

So, I have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year.  To any educators who might be reading this, it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime, and because of the math and bit of strategy involved, you don't feel guilty about it at all.  Plus, it is something different and for the teacher, inexpensive as far as games go

This was my first Schleich World of Knights figure, given to me Christmas of this year. It's a highly detailed classic dragon, with no moving or detachable parts (the wings are an integral part of the figure). As such, it's safe for very young children, and you don't have to worry about someone's eye getting put out. As to its historical accuracy and educational value, I really cannot say, never having seen Dragons in the wild, but the level of detail is wonderful, and it should encourage children to obtain the more "practical" members of the balance of Scheich World of Knights collection, which are excellent, as well

I recently purchased this game using a gift certificate.  My little boy LOVES it. I think it's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards.  Frankly, there needs to be better proof reading.  Was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the USA.  That would probably account for it

We had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one. My girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make. The music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them ( ages 20 months and 3 1/2 )

It takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game, but once learned, it is a lot of fun. A good game for four players, and a great game for six players.  It generates lots of lively action, with the bidding for the cards.

We played this game on a cruise with four strangers. They were no longer strangers, after the game.  Everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it.  That's how we got it.  Bought the game after playing with family.

This figure is one of the best in the marvel legends series. I have over forty of the marvel legends figures and this is the tallest. The hair on his body looks real and his joints aren't to tight, but not to lose either their just right. I couldn't wait for them to release more Exiles members like Noctourne, Blink, Morph, & Mimic. I wasn't very happy to see the marvel legends series coming to an end with the seperation of marvel from Toy Biz the last series are going to be realeased later this year. I'm glad to see Psylocke & Falcon before the series end, but what about the wildly popular She Hulk. They've got the loser Sabertooth from the Exiles coming out, but not She Hulk. If you're going to bring an Exiles to the series at least bring characters we like. NOCTOURNE, MORPH, BLINK, MIMIC!!!!

We purchased this game for our son for Christmas.  He is a chess lover, and we wanted to get him something a little different.  Chaturanga was perfect, since it is the precursor to chess.  He has enjoyed the game.  All of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition.  It is an attractive box.   We are very pleased with every aspect of it

Chaturanga is the oldest known form of chess.  It dates back to India in the seventh century A.D.  Front Porch classics has carefully re-created this game and it is now available to everyone!

The game itself is beautiful.  It is played on a fabric playing board (all games were once played on fabric, it's extremely portable and cheap, and cardboard wasn't even invented until the late 1800's!).  Unlike chess, the game can be played with two to four players.  Each player gets 8 playing pieces, made of clay: A Raja, an elephant, a horse (cavalry), a ship and four infantrymen.  These pieces are kept in beautiful velvet bags.  Each piece does have a loose equivalent in modern chess.

The Raja is the most important piece, much like the king.  The elephant acts much like the rook.  The ship is the bishop, and you cannot capture a Raja with the ship.  The Cavalry moves exactly like a knight.  The infantry, which in this game look kind of like tiny Buddhas in lotus position, are like the pawns.  The big difference between Chaturanga and chess is that Chaturanga is played with a four-sided die (it's a long rectangle, instead of a perfectly square cube).  The die tells you which piece you have to move.

The game is somewhat easier to learn than chess, but easily as much fun.  The game can and should be used by teachers and parents to introduce their children to the history and culture of India.  The rulebook includes lots of interesting information about India as well as about the history of the game.

The game comes in a convenient Bookshelf Edition, where the game is kept in a beautiful book-shaped box that looks great on any bookshelf or coffee table

We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. She was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother. In addition, her five cousins (ages 5-16) and their father (36)were also captivated. There are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. Initially, she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. She is fourteen months now and puts them back on. She presses the button to watch them spin. She has taken it to the sitter's and the kids there have played with it all day. When we take it to the sitter's, I put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical. So far,it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently. We rotate toys, but I leave this one out continuously and I often find her playing with it quietly by herself. I have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can even be stacked), is different from all other toys they have, appeals to a wide range of ages, grows with the child, does not use up batteries (we are still on the first set), and seems very durable. I recommend this toy

This game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes.  It is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose, or money to count.  The strategies, however, are numerous, and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay.

I really liked how the game could ONLY be played with two people, as I was tired of games that COULD be played with two, but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more...

Game Contents: 1 deck of game cards, and one small board.  Note: If you want to make this game really portable you don't even need to bring the board.  It is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards.  As long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game, you can play it everywhere that you have a table.  (I figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical Monopoly board).

Playing Note: One thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent.  You can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to head manner.  We were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees.  The game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this way, even though you DO need to turn your board for the same effect.

This game is really fun and I would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (Rio Grande Games).  They really have a knack for publishing great strategy games.  They even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards.  Pretty neat

This is the first game I've tried by the venerable Reiner Knizia.  I was really taken in by the combination of simple rules, but interesting strategy.  Since then, I've purchased several of his games.  For those who like Lost Cities, but also have a soft spot for Poker, try Battleline.  Samurai is a great introduction to the sometimes complicated world of "tile games", with Tigres and Euphrates being the much more complicated cousin (although again, the rules aren't that complicated...the difficulty comes via strategic decision making.)

So far, my all time favorite Knizia game...and frankly, one of my favorite games period, is Modern Art.  The game mechanics are fairly simple, easily explained in 5 minutes, with some of the more complex bidding rules explained in a trial game.  Essentially, it's a game about playing an auction...who is the best at playing the market, guessing at art values, and spending money wisely.  It's also a true crossover game... non-gamers, or those only exposed to the standard Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, etc, will quickly learn how much fun it can be... and will probably be asking to play again

Lost Cities is a really fun game, and very addictive.  I've personally played over 200 matches already on the free online version available at http://www.flexgames.com/  Check it out and play against some really good players across the globe and get a feel for the game itself before buying.  I've had my name in the notification list for this game on amazon.com for some time now, so I'll definitely be purchasing it right away

Speaking of Barbie I also reccommend the singer AQUA she sings " I'm a Barbie Girl." Buy Cloe and the others while you can!!! It's worth it and it will be a decision you will NEVER in your whole entire life, however long that may be, regret

My two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles. They're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles. It's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but aren't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles. There's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge. The only downside are some of the very small pieces...definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3

Well, this is the expansion for Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY AWESOME

Maybe it's my computer or browser, but the picture here doesn't do this doll justice.  I bought one at my local drug store before I saw it here at Amazon.  I can tell you that this Beach Glam Barbie is gorgeous!  The picture here looks faded to me, but I have the doll right here in front of me, and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid pink, not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this photo.

This is a great Barney musical songbook, and can also be used as a play piano.  It's great that it has an auto turn off, after non-use.  However, if it is turned off, and something touches it, it automatically turns on by itself.  Many times, after the kids went to bed, and we happen to put something on top of the Barney Sing 'n Play Songbook, it turns on by itself.  Because the Songbook does not have a physical turn off switch, and something touches it, Barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep.  Just wish it has an on/off switch, so it will not be turned on accidentally.  Otherwise, my 3 year old loves it

My son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago, when he was two. It was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own. He loved it and played with nothing else for a week! The songs are cute and familiar to him, plus Barney talks and sings to the music. The only draw backs were that I couldn't find an off button and that it is $20+ at local retailers. I wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack. LOL

This Schleich Haflinger is a good buy. Schleich is as detailed as Breyer, and are as big as Breyer Paddock Pals. This Haflinger stallion is a palomino, with a shaggy mane and tail. This horse is full of personality, and is well worth the money. Your kid will love this model horse.

I don't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with. She has such a pretty dress and vail. Her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem. I would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me I still really want him. The barbie with blond hair is also very pretty

We have had this sandbox for five years.  It has been durable and my two kids ages 3 and 5 just love it.  Color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun for years.  Sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes sand play even funner for kids.  We tend to put a rock on top of lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly.  It is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is easy for kids to remove and put back on when done.  The kids usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it as well.  I find most kids dont want to get sand all over and end up sitting outside of it regardless. Overall good investment and the kids love it

I noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt a need to speak up.  We bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three.  We lived in an apartment with a small back patio.  It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play.  He played for hours!!  Now 5 years later, his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still plays with the little one in it.  It still looks brand new, nestled under the tree in our big back yard.  It's really great just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend it

I give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons: first, humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus, and second, the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set.  My mother sent this toy as a gift for my son's first birthday.  The package suggests this toy for ages 2-5, and in typical fashion, my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself, but my three-year-old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy.  She began role-playing with the dinosaurs right away.  "I love you very much," said the mama dinosaur to her baby.  Supercute

This is a GREAT way to get your child(ren) to do the things that need to be done around the house.  I purchased two, one for each of my older children and they love that they have control over keeping up with the board. It is easy for them to use and easy for you to keep track of their progress.

I just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls (3 and 5)  with it today.  It does blow tons of bubbles!  They love chasing them all over the yard.  The Gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out.  It does used 8 AA batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor.  Yes, it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you don't use so many batteries.  Where I'll plug it in in the backyard I'm not sure yet.  I definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles

This thing is great. Our 4 year old loves it.  The working drawbridge, breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great.  Considering the size and number of pieces, it was remarkably easy to put together.  Allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly, but the directions are excellent.  Only complaint is that some of the small pieces that don't always want to stay together - some of the "details" will likely be missing after a few weeks.  Overall, very happy with it

My son received this toy as a present from his father on Christmas (Dec '05) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box.  I bought my son the V Smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system.  While a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right.  While with the V smile system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system.  I have  only one complaint and that is  I wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters.  My son loves Thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could I think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages.  But all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.

This is a must-have item if you want to add the Clock Tower to your set.  It also works well with the other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain.

The set includes the following:

4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together)
2 curves
2 short straights
2 guard rails
2 end ramps
8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each)

The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned.  The screws are a little tough but never need to be removed.  The set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back down).  You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other setups.

This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set.  Lots of fun.  The short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past.  Definitely fun.

There are so many great things about this that I don't know where to start.  Availability--price--shipping--the list goes on and on.  Bottom line is that my daughter is a big Care Bear fan and it's impossible to find this bear anywhere else.  It arrived quickly, was just as described (in fact it was softer) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter's bed.  I give it a 5, only because that's the highest.  Makes a wonderful gift!!

This doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years. The Lucy in Paris Barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago. This doll will probably go up in value as well. In regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box...GET A LIFE! Who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent! If the doll wasn't damaged why are you returning it????
It's life, nothing's perfect, GET OVER IT! You can't expect perfection...as long as the item itself isn't damaged there's no reason to make a big fuss over the cardboard box it comes in! This is a nice doll (even if the box is dented) and I would recommend purchasing it. I ordered this doll and the box mine came in was in good shape (to me anyway). As far as I know, buyers on ebay aren't extremely picky on the condition of the box...they are more concerned on the condition of the doll and whether or not it is still in the box.

I'm not sure why so many of these (all?) reviews are for a different product, but this one is actually for the balancing bike. We got this for our son for Christmas and he loves it. He just turned 5 and has a bike with training wheels but it's still too big for him. I don't really like the idea of training wheels anyway so I started looking for something like this balancing bike. I saw a German one for $350 so I was thrilled to find this one for under $100.

It was so easy to assemble. I love that the seat height adjusts. My son rides it around the house and after just a few tries was able to coast down the hall on it with his feet off the floor. I think it's a much better way to learn to ride a bike.

The quality is good, the seat has a bit of padding, and I expect it will hold up well for my other child when she's old enough to ride it in a couple more years.

I gave it four stars instead of five because it's put together with screws, it's not fine craftsmanship. Best buy in its category though

I loved this trike!  It was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it.  Daycare was in walking distance (I lived in the city) and I used the trike to take him.  My son loved to hold onto the handle bars, it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated.  My son is now three years old and I am buying a new one for my one year old. I understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy.  The brand  Radio Flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects.  This is the only gift that was given to my son that I can say "I LOVE" and have had for more than just one year!  Enjoy

We recently purchased this playhouse, and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters (I don't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description).  Our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it, but I would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually "do" inside the house.  The doorbell makes fun sounds.  It is very easy to put together

I give this 4 stars, because I like it (maybe more than my toddler). When I was in kindergarten or 1st grade, my little brother, who was 1 or 2 at the time, had the original -- the one that just popped, and he loved it.  He would push it around until the popping drove my father "crazy." This one does even more.  It pops, counts from 1 to 10, plays music, and has flashing lights.  I think it's an awesome toy, especially for the price.  My daughter doesn't play with it every day, but when she grabs it, she'll push it around for maybe 10 minutes or more (we haven't found a single toy that will occupy her attention for longer than that).  Sometimes, she'll push it around several times a day.  It's great for that stage when your toddler likes to push or drag things around with them.  The popping was inconsistent when we first received it, but we took it apart, got the gears aligned correctly (through trial & error), added more Vaseline to the gears for lubrication, and now it pops, counts, plays music, and the lights flash consistently every time.  If you take this toy apart, be careful not to pull out the speaker wires -- we did that, but it was no problem.  My husband soldered the wires back together

I bought this game two weekends ago and have had both fun and frustration with it.  I'm a Freecell junkie and have gone so far as to download a better version (more games) than the one that came with my computer.  I lost track of how many total games I've played over the years since I've used several computers, but I play about 10 games a day on average.  I'm very competitive and love keeping track of my stats.  Unfortunately, that is the weakness of this version of the game.  For example, if you get into a position were you can move only one card back and forth between two columns and there are no other moves, all you can do is hit the replay button or move on to another game.  If you hit the replay button you don't get a loss recorded, which of course you should.  Consequently, it is easy to run up a high win percentage with this version of the game just by resigning a game when you think you are going to loose and replay it.  Then when you finally win, you get credit for a win.  Of course, that is not proper scoring either.  Also, there is a key combination that when you do lose a game outright and want to replay, you don't get any further losses counted against you.  That's as it should be.  The only problem is that key combination is very flaky and doesn't always work.  Other than scoring inconsistencies, it's a great game!  It's very easy to use.  Although different to use than playing with a mouse on your computer, if you've played a lot on your computer you'll pick up the operation of this version almost immediately.  The display is large and easy to see, and there is a low light level sensor on the front that will automatically light the screen when you are playing in an area with poor lighting.  That is a great feature.  I love playing this game while sitting in the airport waiting to board a plane and on the plane itself while in the air.  It's a great and challenging way to pass the time away if you like playing solitaire.  On the next version of this game, I hope they will beef up the statistics capabilities of the unit

This is the third or fourth Quixo game we have purchased to give as a gift!  We originaly recieved ours as a gift about 5 years ago and it has been a favorite ever since.  Quixo is tic tac toe with pieces that move.  You have a strategy, then oops, your opponent chages it all with one move. It is suitable for anyone from age 8 to adult.  We keep ours out at all times - a coffee table game.  It is very high quality with real wooden blocks as playing pieces.  Enjoy!

We have this product and LOVE it!  At first we had a problem with the hooves not working.  I called the number on the box.  They were wonderful and sent me new hooves at no expense or item return.  Then I find it was user error!  Santa didn't realize there were buttons in the heel of the hoof that push down when walking.  I called the company back and they told me not to worry about the exta hooves they sent.  To enjoy.  I would order from them again

 This is without a doubt the best [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son, but it isn't a toy. It's a highly functional, albeit inexpensive, metal detector. We've had it now for 3 years and take it camping, etc.
It will easily find something as small as a rusty staple, and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down, very good if you consider how small the detection coil is. When camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes, rusty nails, and the occasional coin.
Adjusting the sensitivity is trivial, just hold it away from any metal, and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector LED just goes out. Other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily, which happened on ours, but a little duct tape goes a long way and this shouldn't stop you from buying one.
If you get one, make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find.
PS It also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls

After three years of dragons who walk on all fours, we get a dragon who stands upright.  Seems kind of strange.  Thoron's debut appearance was in the "Fire & Ice" Portal Of Fire set.  He makes another appearance here in The Metal Ages, and he looks a lot meaner here.  Perhaps the rigors of battle are wearing on him.  I bought Stendhal first and was very pleased with him.  I found Thoron to be somewhat disappointing.  He's got some great detail, but he's not as articulated as Stendhal is.  Replacing the standard light-up feature is a dragon roar feature.  Thoron doesn't light up, but he has a variety of growls and roars that are activated by a button on his chest.

His articulation is pretty decent.  His hind legs (which he stands on) are stiff and can only move back and forth.  But it gets much better when we examine his arms and head.  His arms can move back and forth, and away from his body.  The shoulder joint can move in two directions.  We get two additional points of articulation at the elbows and wrists.  Thoron's wrists aren't as versatile as Stendhal's are (Stendhal's wrists can turn in addition to the claw moving back and forth).  His neck can move left and right, and his head can move in all manner of directions.  As always, his jaw opens.  His tail is flexible for super-posability, as are his towering wings.  He can also turn at the waist.  My complaints with Thoron's articulation are twofold.  It would've been nicer if his hind legs were posable, and it definitely would've been nice if his wrists were articulated like Stendhal's are.

Thoron is mostly dark green with white highlights on his wings, white claws on his feet, and silver colored armor.  As mentioned, the detail here is better than ever, and everything has a realistic look.  He comes with a removable piece of armor for his head.  I think he looks better without it, but maybe that's just me.  Thoron is one of the most charismatic dragons I've seen (it's all in the face and eyes).  He looks kind of mean and vicious.  Stendhal is supposed to be the bad guy, and he doesn't look this mean.  The original Thoron from the Fire & Ice series has a better facial expression.

This action figure comes almost completely assembled.  I just had to attach his wings.  Also included are some parts for building a small tower with decorative blades and flag, and a Draigar warrior with shield and weapon.

All things considered, Thoron isn't quite as nice as Stendhal is.  Nevertheless, he gets a thumbs up from me.  He's a good addition to any dragons collection and a fun action figure to play around with

My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's easily his favorite toy.  He'll gladly do tummy time hitting the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters.  He has a great time making it go, and will now sit up and scoot the car a little.  His other toys were good for a couple weeks at best, this one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with it.  The music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys and is actually a little fun. Well worth the purchase price

 This Barbie is better than some of the other new ones but I did`nt see the street style one yet.But I don`t know if they are that good by the reviews i am hearing so far.I like her outfit,typical,shop-o-holic and typical school girls is quite nice and fits her personality.She has a locker with basic stuff you take to school with a secret inside.Her out fit is denim capri`s,black jacket,matching beret,and a tube top with a necklace

Pixter is a fantastic learning tool for ages 3+. As a parent, I love that many of the learning activities are based around drawing and creating so the child is not only gaining knowledge but also creating art at the same time. My son who will be 2 in a few weeks has a Pixter, and though he is far below the age recommendation, he absolutely adores drawing with his Pixter. He is very gentle with it and it can keep him entertained for hours.

Compared to the LeapFrog Leapster, Pixter has many more creativity-based activities and Leapster tends to be more of an arcade-style system. However, the Leapster cartridges are much easier to find and there is a bigger selection of titles. I plan to purchase the Leapster for my son for his 3rd birthday because the L-MAX can play games on the TV as well as on the handheld.

Also, contrary to popular belief, the Pixter is NOT being discontinued as of this writing. I spoke with a representative at Fisher Price myself and she said that they are redesigning the system with new colors but not discontinuing it or any of the software. Beware when purchasing these games on eBay for ridiculous prices from people claiming they are discontinued. Wait for the stores to restock after the holidays and it will be a different story

We have this up on the wall for our baby and use it as a diaper changing night light.  The luminosity is just right for changing baby but is not too blinding for sleepy eyes.   My 9-year daughter also loves to cycle through the phases before bedtime.

The room has to be very bright for the night light to turn off automatically.  The remote is very handy and we liked the 3 viewing options.

We'll be getting this as gifts for our friends and their babies.

This is the first RC (radio control) aircraft I have ever flown, although I have raced RC cars for quite awhile. It comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro DVD to get you in the air quickly.

I started out in my living room and it has worked just great. With just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel. I've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and I'm getting pretty good at hovering although I still have a tough time with head-in flight (controls thus reversed).

The Blade CX RTF makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli. Probably fine for anyone over 10 years old. I am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge. The only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes (typical with all LiPo batteries). I'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger. Also I have tried the Training Gear add-on for the Blade CP/CP Pro -- it fits the CX just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the Blade CX slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so. They're probably worth the trade off at first.

In a few more hours I think I'll be ready to move up to the Blade CP Pro. Highly recommended for anyone interested in entering RC helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house.

Two good sites for further info are [...]

We have the original &quot;Super Mastermind&quot; which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts

This is a great lego set.  My 1 1/2 year old son loves them.  He crashes the truck and Caravan all the time and they never break.  He really likes the Bob and cat that come with it.  These are also the right size to use with the Bob click brick sets.  This truck fits in to the parking thing with the talking click brick trucks

We just got this for my daughter's 5th Birthday. This toy was what received the greatest excitement. While opening presents, my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs, "I got a Brietta Pegasus!" The pegasus itself is durable, beautiful, and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play. I didn't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box. Many toys are packaged that way these days... Perhaps an anti-theft plan. I just got some scissors and Brietta was out to play. So far we also haven't had any trouble with the wings. If they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in. A small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours. As a mom who also loved unicorns and Pegasus ponies as a girl, I'm glad I can give that magic to my own girls

THIS TOY IS GREAT FOR MANY REASONS!! Tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters. You get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers! Each character has point value and rarity. If you're lucky, you might get one of the very rare Tengamos and sell it for $$$$ on Ebay! You can also play hundreds of games with the Tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack. Hurry to collect all of Series 1 before it is "retired" for Series 2.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I went online to look for other Little Tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and I wondered why. I disagree with most of the other reviews. The handle on top makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up slopes, on the ground, anywhere. He has never fallen or injured himself on it. In fact his frustration occurs because he can only pull the dump truck end up about 50% of the time. Usually he just hands it to me, and points that he wants it open. I do agree that the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it difficult for items to fall out. This is the only reason I'm not giving this toy five stars. But my son loves this truck and has pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about a month ago. I'm planning to get him the train with the handle because he likes this toy so much.

This is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old. She loves this pool. I love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water - it stands up. Less risk of tears or holes! The only thing I would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one

My daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it.  This pool is big enough that I can just get in with her and we have a blast.  Because of her age I don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it just looks a little funny) I found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away.  I was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments I had it put away and every time I use it I find it easier and easier. This pool is great for traveling to Grandma's house too!  I would recommend this to anyone young and old

When my 3-month old nephew received this for Christmas, my 15-month old and 3-year old immediately started fighting over it.  They played with it so much that we decided to buy our own, even though I thought they might be too old for it.  Two months later, it is still the hottest toy in our house.  The shapes are vibrant colors, rattle, and have rounded edges, making them easier than most shape sorters for younger children.  The top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the shapes, and my 3-year old can take them on and off herself.  My kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle.   They also like to play "catch" by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other.  I would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6-18 month old

I wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones.  This product, the FP3 Speakers, was perfect.  She loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around.  It is easy to turn on and very kid friendly.  The only downfall is that the price dropped right after I purchased it!

My son received this when he was 15 months old and has never stopped playing with it regularly.  He loves putting things in the back and zooming around the living room.  Great buy

This game is make-involve, make-think and fun. Side effects leave you much smarter. Its fun game for parties driving everyone to involvement and fun.

Art of asking questions and elimination gets better and better just by playing this game !!!!!. Strongly recommended for parents who want their kids to spend time on creative and learning game, yet fun. They can be be part of game and share there thoughts. Though it recommends age 10+ might as well be good for 7+ to 100+ ..."

I wish I had this game little earlier, never stop telling how much its fun and good for personality development!!

This is a game that will help you practice, while you are having fun, to ask the right questions, to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the progress. I believe it is the right questions that you ask that help you succeed in a game or in life.This is a game with a educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a dose of fun.If you liked Pictionary you will love Questionary.

SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL DOLL. I LOVE THE BLONDE PONYTAIL AND THE MAKE-UP IS FINE. I EVEN LIKE THE JEANS. BUT WHY THE UGLY WHITE UNTUCKED SHIRT AND THE SUPER-SHORT PINK SWEATER??? IT JUST LOOKS TAKCY TO ME. IF I BUY HER SHE WILL BE WEARING A NEW SHIRT RIGHT AWAY. OTHER THAN THAT SHE'S A LOVELY DOLL. AND I, LIKE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER, ALSO REMEMBER AND LOVE THE ARCHIE COMICS FROM MY CHILDHOOD. A 5 STAR DOLL EXCEPT FOR THE SHIRT

We purchased this set for my son Christmas 2003.  He loves it.  The age range on the listing is off, though.  It should be the same for any of the Little People toys - 12 or 18 months and up.  There are no small parts.  Highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time

We  bought two sets of the Alphabet Foam Play Mats - so glad we did!  We have a concrete basement floor, and now the kids have a nice, colorful, and soft place to play.  Plus, the foam floor isn't as cold as the concrete - wer're in Colorado.  The colors are great - so inviting.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and the border gives it a finished look.  Great purchase!  We'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area!

I added this toy to my son's xmas list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment value still exists. The planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for  nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the  planets!  The stars the set comes with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !!

My nephew who is 3 years old got My First LeapPad not to long ago and he loves it. He loves train so he got one that is Thomas the train and he playes it the morning when he get up and at night before he goes to sleep. There are many different types, and they are everywhere you just have to know where to look. For instance [...] Over all I think this is an amazing learning toy for toddler and young kids who look forward to reading and writting.

I really like My first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son.
 I bought it for him for Christmas last year (he was 2 1/2 then)and though some the activities we're alittle hard for him to start with, there were still plenty of things he could do with it.Every picture you touch the pen on says a frase/says the name of the object or make a sound,so even without playing the games he still had great fun with it.
 A year on,he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make words,so now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for him,so he is still learning from this toy after a year!
 I will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this Christmas,this toy is worth every penny

Got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she "played" with, well more like laid and stared at.  Now she's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it.  She loves to grab at the fish, shake the rattle and twirl the lobster.  For awhile, it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it.  Great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat.  Also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom.  Music isn't too annoying either

This is a very pretty doll. I waited until this year to buy her and got her for only fifteen dollars. In my opinion that is the only way to buy these fancy dolls--ON SALE! Otherwise they are just too darn expensive. I give this particular doll 4 stars. She has a pretty face and I like her hair. I think the dress is a bit overdone but that is just me.

I bought the African-American 2005 Holiday Barbie for my little girl.  I agree with her statement that "She's too pretty to play with!!".  Mattel did an amazing job this year.  The face on this doll is EXQUISITE. "Miss 2005" is absolutely proportionate in classic Barbie terms. The gown's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit.  In fact, the ball gown, as a whole, is supernaturally beautiful.  Picking Bob Mackie as this year's designer was nothing short of GENIUS.  When I saw that Mackie was the HOLIDAY designer, I knew that Mattel had finally gotten it right!

I don't have the tin version but an earlier version.  The cards look different but the game is played the same.  I have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it.  A little luck, some strategy, and a whole lot of fun.  Don't let the age levels fool  you-adults will enjoy this as well.  A classic that will never go out of style

My 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last Christmas, and for the first couple of months was used practically every day. (And yes, I agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them, and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck.) I will tell you that I cannot BELIEVE my son has not touched this engine since. His complaint is that all it does is go around and around. Instead, he enjoys playing out stories from Thomas, or making up his own train sagas. My husband likes to watch the engine more than my son. I don't know how other children play with their trains, but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long. Nevertheless, for the first few months, watching it is really mesmerizing, I could watch it for hours. Perhaps instead of buying this one engine, purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money. It will probably get more use in the end

Why people purchase a toy for tikes when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me. Always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for. That said, all LTTO taggers, including this one, have a simple "grab and go" game called LTAG. All you have to do is pull the trigger twice and you're on your way. This is early in the manual, way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6 year olds and their parents.

I love LTTO. I even run a club that uses it here in Auburn, WA. But I *always* start new players out with LTAG, then move up to hosted games, and then to the more complicated games. Never try to start out by hosting a team Hide and Seek game, 'cus it's just too much for a young or completely new player. But that's why the LTAG game exists! Just grab it and play! No messing with the control panel.

Don't take a low rating based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much. Similarly, take my rating with a grain of salt since I'm a huge fan. But for kids 8 and up to adults, LTTO taggers are a wonderful, durable, and long lived toy that gets you moving AND thinking

It would be easier to keep score on a book that is not glossy or bound; ink smears, pencil does not show up, and writing in the crease is difficult.  They should include a score book similar to the typical baseball scoring books; spiral bound, paper.  Other than that, the product is exactly what we were looking for.

I purchased this card game as a spur of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but can get no one to play the board game because of how long the board game version takes. My son as well as the rest of the family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game addictive and fun to play.  Each of the hands goes quickly and the goal of $10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short period of time. I will have to admit 3 people was a bit more challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier to keep score of the money by using pencil, paper, and a calculator. Overall, I highly recommend this version

My 2.5 year old Border Collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week.  Since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey, I decided to try this more affordable kid's tunnel instead. It's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels, but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it's still very usable.

My ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability

I've read the other reviews...as I was skimming the website to order another of these wands.  Guess you folks had a bad batch of wands, because my son is crazy about his.  We gave it to him shortly after his 2nd birthday, and it's one of his favorite toys!  Yes, it is messy...it's a giant bubble wand...when was the last time you played bubbles that there wasn't a mess?  But if you keep it out doors, I don't see the problem.  My son was able to make bubbles right away (something he wasn't able to do with smaller wands since he can't seem to blow (he sucks air in instead of out).  His father and I played for over an hour with this wand...taking turns making the bubbles and letting him pop them (and vice versa).  I don't know why the other folks had some difficulty...but I would highly recommend this toy for a 2-3 year old.

We wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06.  We bought a lot of M&D toys and this by far was the better of their toys.  Even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out.  Like other said the sound is very appropriate.  I like this toy and definitely recommend this to others. The only reason I gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful

This is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set.  A nice selection of straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun.

While Brio in general is expensive, this track pack represents a pretty good value (v. buying switches, curves, straights, etc on their own.... although you'll "need" to do that eventually too!).

The finish, fit, and quality is great.  Worth the money considering the play it'll get & it's durability

Great idea to hang clothes. The hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on.  If your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls, the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. The price is great now. I paid $20.  Great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer.

My son loves this game.  When moving around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go, after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. I hope this helps.  My son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks.  Mom, dad and sis had to play before that.  The other games are a little easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves it

My child loves this little crib.  I think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers.  She can easily move it without having to carry it to the next room.   All her dolls fit the crib.  We really think it works.  It isn't as sturdy as a wooden crib, but it hasn't come apart on us

This is an awsome ship! Well at least Anakins is. My cousin has a green Anakin jedi starfighter and I want to get the new Obi-wan Kenobi one that is coming in September. The only thing that is not good about it is that there is a little opening in the cockpit that Anakin's hand (the Green ship comes with an Anakin that has a normal hand and one holding a lightsaber) fell through

I think that this was a great gift and definitely worth the money. I gave this to my 3 1/2 yr old niece as a Christmas gift. She loves the Wizard of Oz. She is a big fan of dress up clothes and I also have two more nieces that roughly the same age so there was an outfit for each of them.

I bought a set of these Uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson, a Nintendo "freak." The first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy, and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so. He took them to bed with him. A few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's house showing off his fancy deck of Uno cards and insisted that they play a game. He even wrote us a Thank You note telling us that the cards were the "coolest present I ever got."

The rules of the game have not changed, just the look of the cards. Nintendo characters, in all their bright colors, are the "suits." The cards are housed in a metal box, a throwback to the front half of the 20th Century. Excellent art work on the cards and on the box.

The cards and the game are appealing to all ages. I enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the Nintendo characters (my grandson explained them all to me). This is a great family game and this Nintendo set is a great gift. It helps close the "generation gap." I highly recommend this item. Enjoy.

One last thing: I bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same.

Now you can add Risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition.  The game remains a perennial favorite, and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone, atleast not physically.  But, be prepared for a few bruised egos, especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims.  While the places and names don't exactly match today's geographical boundaries, kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live, even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out

Love this game. With family and/or friends it's one of the best card games around. It is easy and doesn't require a lot of attention (you can watch movies, talk, hang out, etc.) yet keeps your interest. It's also a game people of many ages can play because it's not too difficult. A good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame.

I found that for the price. this set was great!  It comes with one Rascus figure, and one shadow knight.  The catapult is very orginal, and powered by a rubber band, I got it to go 3 and a half feet.  There were also some improvements in the pieces.  For example, the flagpole was less annoying, the weapons were improved, and the head pieces came on and off much smoother.

Whether you are starting Lego Castle or are an expert builder, this is great set

We just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it!  He doesn't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time.  The Scoop and Lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings, but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them.  Overall, this is a great toy for anyone who loves Bob the Builder.  We can't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun!!  Lego always makes great and challenging toys!

Whenever we take this bike to the park, boys and men of every description crown around it in awe.  My son, who is seven and so far not athletic at all, loves the recognition, not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching.  We just wish it came in an adult size

You need to be old enough to look at a set of several horse cards and decide which kind of horse show a particular hose would do best in and which horse you would get the most points for if you had that particular horse compete in a dressage show, jumper show, ect. points are added up and who evers horse earned the most points wins that horse show and that player gets to keep the cards. So I would say ages 8 to 12, but younger children could play with help from someone who can read and add up numbers.

There is a limited amount of rounds in a game, since there is a limited number of cards to play for each horse show so the game last around 15 minutes or so. I like this part a lot, since games like war "Chomp" can go on forever.

It does take a table top to play the game, I originally purchased the game for my daughter thinking she could play it on the bus with a friend, but you need to have a surface to lay out some cards. I quess you could try to squeeze them onto a larger text book laid onto your lap. But it wouldn't be easy.

I bought this as a Halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004.  He loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house.  He doesn't really use it much anymore, but now my 18 month old loves it!  He can actually follow the whole progression, turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time.  This toy has been great for our family.  It is pretty durable, some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore, but considering what it has gone through, it has performed amazingly well

Well, I just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product.  Can you even imagine her tooting?  She's too cute!  The slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends.  This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell.  One warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device.  Please use a real loud whistle.  You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid.  If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would most likely run the other way.  This whistle is for good times only.

Toby is one of the regulars on the Thomas & His Friends TV series, and this little wooden tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets.

My only complaint - and this is very minor - is that Toby is a bit taller than other wooden Thomas engines, meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well

My 7 year old son got this set for Christmas last year, and with all the toys we have for our 5 kids, this K'nex set gets the most use.  He built with it every day for months, and still builds something new about every week with it.  He has built about every model in the book and he is getting better at building his own ideas.  We've gotten a lot of the models on video tape, and he loves to show his grandparents the new ones.  I loved the sea turtle that "walked" across the floor, and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people in them.  This thing keeps him busy for hours at a time, and he's getting another tub of them for his birthday.  His little brother wants one for his birthday this year.  The motor is very cool, and he figures out how to use it with the models that don't call for it.  Since Christmas, he has only broken 2 pieces, so I thought that was pretty good.  Highly recommended

If you know the movies inside and out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan.  I play with my son that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the game enjoyable.  The only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck.  Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so many questions wrong

Star Wars Trivial Pursuit Saga Edition (2005.)

INTRODUCTION:
Despite having been around since the middle of the seventies, the Star Wars series has never declined in its popularity. George Lucas created a science fiction phenomenon that has stood the test of time, and then some. And needless to say, many games have been based on the series - video games, role-playing games, and no shortage of board games have been adapted for the Star Wars universe. In 1998, Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was released. Being a die-hard fan of the series, it was by far my favorite (non video game) Star Wars game ever. Unfortunately, it outdated fast, due to the fact that it didn't cover the prequel trilogy it was immediately followed by. But in 2005, seven years and three Star Wars episodes later, a new version of the game has hit store shelves! Read on for my review of the new version of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit.

OVERVIEW:
Quite honestly, who doesn't know what Trivial Pursuit is? Well, for those of you who have been living under a rock all your life, here's the concept behind the game. Players alternate rolling a die and moving their game token across a wheel-shaped board. There are six different-colored spaces. Each color represents a different category. The player is then asked a question of that category. If he or she gets it right, he or she goes again. If he or she misses it, it's the next player's turn. At six spots on the board are wedge spaces. The objective of the game is to gain a wedge in all six colors and return to the central hub of the wheel, and answer a game-winning question. Some changes for this edition of the game are, rather obviously, the questions and overall game design being Star Wars based, and two DVDs, which contain the wedge and game-winning questions. A new concept to the game includes a player being able to "steal" if another player is unable to answer the wedge question, in the last few seconds of time. Essentially, the game play stays play to the classic stylings of Trivial Pursuit, but gives it a Star Wars overhaul. In other words, this game is exactly what it says it is.

REVIEW:
The original Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was, without question, my favorite Star Wars game of all time that wasn't a video game. This new version is a MASSIVE improvement over the old version. For starters, the new version covers the ENTIRE Star Wars film saga. The classic Galactic Civil War trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI) AND the prequel Clone Wars trilogy (Episodes I, II, and III) all get equal emphasis. If you hated the original version for not covering the prequel trilogy, that problem has, obviously, been corrected, and in a major way. The DVDs also add a nice new twist to the game. It's good to finally have a method of setting the wedge questions apart from regular questions. And, of course, you can do anywhere from two to four players or teams. I do have a few minor complaints, though. First of all is the selection of the tokens of characters you can play as. The original version had Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Darth Vader. In other words, a nice assortment of main characters. The new version has Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda. In other words, ONLY JEDI CHARACTERS. This is strictly a cosmetic flaw, but still, I think they could have picked a better assortment of characters than those four. Another complaint is the inclusion of a die. For those of you who never played the original version of the game, it included an electronic R2D2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces to move when you tapped its head, via an LCD screen. I liked that better than rolling a die because it helped to give the game a unique Star Wars feel that playing with a die just doesn't have. Another problem is the price of the game - I've seen it everywhere from $45 to $60! Even at the lowest MSRP, it's still a rip off. One of the biggest problems is one of the most obvious - if you're not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you will not get very far in this game. My last and biggest complaint is with the questions themselves - like the original game, they are HORRIBLY imbalanced. Some questions are so simple, a casual fan could answer them easily. Some are so difficult, even die-hards will have trouble with them. This brings me to my complaint about the DVD questions. Not only are these questions really no more difficult than the card questions, but as time ticks down, the questions become EASIER! This makes it ridiculously easy for another player to "steal" the wedge if the question receiver is unable to answer. If I were designing the game, I'd straighten up these flaws. But I'm not, and overall, I am very satisfied with it.

EDITION NOTES:
This game is a fairly recent release, and it remains readily available at most major stores that sell board-style games and movie merchandise. If you want the game, it shouldn't be too hard - just be ready to pay a fairly high price for it.

OVERALL:
Despite some minor issues, this new version of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit is a leaps-and-bounds improvement over the original game. If you're a huge fan of the series who thinks your knowledge of the series is supreme, don't hesitate to buy this game. There have been many Star Wars trivia games/books/etc. over the years, but Star Wars Trivial Pursuit is the ultimate Star Wars trivia experience. No fan should pass this game up

Even better than Scrabble, you build words on the board AND build words "up" by adding letters over existing words.  So "tree" becomes "free" and "braces" becomes "blades".  The scoring might be a little too easy, but if you're hard core, you can use the point values from Scrabble to raise the score difficulty.  The board is small so you have to start thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game, and the game doesn't drag on for too long.  It is addictive and you will not look at words the same way again.

My daughter (age 13) really enjoyed this game. It provides more options than scrabble, which sometimes frustrates her because her Mom and Dad are better at that.

It's soo cute and cuddly! Not only is extra soft, it's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk. It looks realistic too, it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable, the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the "TY" tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face=

I definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game. Unfortunately, that absolutely isn't always the case. One of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80's was Super Password with Bert Convy. The game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle. This edition doesn't reflect on that edition. This board game edition is a example of the original Password with the late Allen Ludden. The game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven't seen the original Password like myself, but it is just delightful. Unfortunately, it isn't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the Bert Convy edition. Hopefully, when Password is remade, it will be just like the themed 80's edition of the NBC game show.

Price: B-

Game: C 1/2+

Fun & Enjoyment: B-

This is a very good Webkinz as the plush and as the virtual pet. It comes with a rare TV and other supplies. it is also very soft. The only bad thing is the price. Don't buy Webkinz online, the price can go up to $50. The real Price is $11.99, which you can find them for that price in stores

sure this doesn't make the popular clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals, but it still works well, and has been copied by many companies.  I even have one with a business name on it.  These fun, functional, and keep a kids imagination engaged.  No noise or batteries needed.  Buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this year

I bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased. It is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all. The corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on. It will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with. The price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products.

I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly.

This game is a particularly nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic "tow truck".  Melissa and Doug have made two other puzzles similar to this, a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle, with the same concept.  This one, however, might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks.

One of our pieces (on the fishing version of this puzzle) did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent toy!

I can't believe how well made this set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not plastic. I just received my order today and these items are great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her.
I ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender!

I also had a problem with the velcro on the butter.  It was an easy fix with some super glue.  I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off

If you are a hardcore Family Guy fan like me (I am actually one of the few people that watched Family Guy when it was originally on the air), you will not be disappointed with this Monopoly version. The box is beautifully designed with the Griffin family pictured on center, and some easter eggs to look around for. The board is not the most impressive one especially compared to The Simpson's and Muppets Monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the Griffins at center. What you will love of the board is the properties, which include everything from Chris' Closet and Seamus' Lighthouse to James Woods High and Geronimo's Palace to The Clam and Channel 5 News to Mayor West's Mansion and finally Petoria, all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the Stewie's Untold Story movie. The property deeds are somewhat disappointing though. The do not have color watermarks like those found in the Simpson's version, but I guess they will do.

Peter's Fishing Boat, Hinden-Peter, Peter-Copter and the Pope Mobile replace the Railroads. I bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $200.00 (Income Tax) for Volcano Insurance or $75.00 for Workplace Sensitivity Training (Luxury Tax) but hey, you can't stay mad for long at the Salesman Guy, right? It would have been cool to have Joe Swanson on the Go To Jail space and have a picture of Quahog Prison on the jail space but well, what can you do?

The Pewter Tokens are nice. You can chose from TV Junkie Peter, Mug in hand Brian, Nose picking Chris, Lois, Stewie in a high chair and Meg (who looks like a Peanut character). You can also order four more tokens that include The Giant Chicken, Quagmire, Joe and the Evil Monkey.

The coolest changes are the Chance and Community Chest cards that are replaced by the What the Deuce! and Giggity! Giggity! Giggity! cards, respectively. They are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like; Made Sheriff of Bumblescum ADVANCE TO GO, Get Liposuction and Implants Pay $100, Confederate Civil War Veterans are After You Go Back 3 Spaces, Take Big Fat Paulie to The Movies as a Favor Collect $25.00, Help Death get a Girlfriend Collect $100, and many more.

The money goes as follows $1 - Meg, $5 - Chris $10 - Lois, $20 - Brian, $50 - Stewie, $100 - Peter, $500 - The Griffins

There are no special rules for this version, which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special Monopoly versions.

To wrap it up I must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done Monopoly game. Family Guy fans will love it making this a great gift. HAVE FUN

The build a figure (BAF) program of Marvel legends keeps on rocking.  This time build a giant 14" Apocalypse.  This BAF is big and cool, super articulated, with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture.  For Apocalypse 5 stars.

For Iron Fist...  Well he's super articulated and does come with the mighty booty (that's the buttocks) of Apocalypse, but really is the weakest figure in this series.  A lot of that is just charater design though.  Green tights with an open v-neck green shirt, and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway, ballet slippers and a dew-rag?  Pretty horrible looking.  If you can, try to find the red suit variant, at least that's a little cool.  Also, the accesories (besides the booty) are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect.  Good luck with that.  They are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands.  Once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off.  Overall, not the quatlity of figure or accesories I'd expect.

But the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one, plus you do still get that booty

we received this for my daughter's 4th birthday.  it has been a lot of fun to play--simple enough for her to play, and hard enough to grow with her for the past year.  although it has a lot of pieces, they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers.

My daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It combines the classic board and memory games together.  The pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable.  The only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily.  We have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box.  An excellent game!!

My 8 year old son LOVES this toy. He has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in by moving a leg back and forth. He likes the food dish that shoots the disc. and also thinks the cryptonite is cool!!! It says it changes colors when warm, but we havent seen that. Maybe nn to run it under hot/cold water?! Overall a fantastic buy

This play tent is great - my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later.  He brings toys in there and "hides" to play.  It is not unsafe, it will tip over at times, but it's so lightweight that it could not hurt him.  I think that it's a great buy for the money and would recommend it

My 3 1/2 year old son has older sisters with iPods and always wants to use them to listen to.  We bought this for him for Christmas and he calls it his iPod and he absolutely loves it.  We download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward.  We also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home.

It's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out

I got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day, for several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the song list. he is able to use it independently, except for pushing the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in a very long time. well worth the money.

It is an okay seat. My only complaint is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair where his legs go and the whole "pummel" thing seem kind of tight and uncomfortable for him. We started him in it at about 4 months. He sits in it for only short periods of time, he gets uncomfortable pretty fast. Otherwise, a decent chair

I'll start off by saying that THIS is the company to buy Naruto headbands from. It is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone's head (trust me, I have a pretty big head). The insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly. A velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate doesn't touch your forehead and cause discomfort. In other words, this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself, and for the price, it is a very nice addition to any Naruto fan's wardrobe

I got this for my 3 year old niece. She loves it and requests that it go with her all the time. The box to hold all the pieces is handy, the magnets are easy and there's lots of variations of outfits. Having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends, parents etc to play along and interact. The only cons I see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy, it could use a handle. And the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit. All in all, a great gift and toy!

My 3 year old daughter has this dress up set and it is great for little hands that are not coordinated enough yet to dress and undress actual Barbi dolls.  She loves changing their outfits and switching their accessories - and I love that she can do this without any frustration.  Mellissa and Doug toys are made with the quality of older toys - they are well constructed and made to last - and the sturdy box allows for easy clean up and storage.

It is a little smaller than I expected...But I guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand. Other than that, It's perfect. My son's room has an Atlanta Braves theme so the colors are perfect. The main reason I bought this was to use as a toy box. So far, it's worked out great! I don't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small don't bother me. The only thing I have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank.

We recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we couldn't be happier. It is sturdy and durable..a hard combination to find these days, looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly!! It only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great. Our son can't wait to get up and play, yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin.I will purchase more of these for the different "toy" areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift

Wingo looks like the real car from the movie, drives great, it was a hit with both my boys ages 3 and 6.  The color on the car is bright and just like the one in the movie, the back of the car is exactly like the one in the movie.  My boys were very excited to see it!  They play and act out the whole cars movie with all their cars

I bought four of these for my husabnd, son in law, daughter and myself for Christmas. I wrapped a bag of marshmallows for each of them and gave them the wrapped guns and marshmallows on Christmas eve. The second they opened the marshmallows they knew what was in the box. They ripped into them and were shooting each other like crazy. They had a blast! I will tell you that the marshmallows do hurt at close range when the gun is pumped way up. My dogs loved it too. They ate all the marshmallows that fell to the floor. Well, not ALL of them..I did find some in the Christmas tree and on the bookshelves. (Yes they played with them in the house.) One trick...to get the marshmallows to shoot really well, we genlty rolled them in our hands from side to side to make the mallow just a bit skinnier. Stale marshmallows work great too

   Ms. Pac Man was always my game back in the day.  She just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor.

   I just received this game in the mail today and after a mad scramble for eight (count 'em EIGHT) AA batteries I got down to business.  I admit that I bought this game for Ms. Pac Man, exclusively.  Here's what I found, in a nutshell:

Pros:

1) Graphics & sound are faithful to the old arcade game with the minor exception of the placement of the score, lives and fruit.  No problem.

2) Old skool joystick.  Nice touch.

3) Plug 'n play set-up.  No brainer.

Cons:

1)  I honestly don't mind cords one bit.  The eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as I don't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any given time.

2)  My main gripe is that the joystick is frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving Ms. Pac in directions I don't want her to go.  I understand, however, that the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and has been slightly improved in this version.  Fair 'nuff.

   All-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as addictive as it was in my youth.

I bought this toy for my 3 year old son before his baby brother was to be born.  He absolutely loves this doll!  I babysit during the day and he took care of his baby right along with me while I cared for the baby I keep.  He had regressed and started wetting his pants again when I began babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for!  The yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but it IS only a doll!  If the baby is not attended to properly to make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she'll eventually just do it on her own so it's not frustrating for my son, great for younger kids.  My husband did not want our son having a "girl" doll and I can't find any clothes to fit the doll to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her.

My 5-year-old adores this addition to his moonsand play set. The kit includes enough sand to make cars and other items to "run over" with the included Monster Truck. He had a ball and still plays with it at least once or so a week after a month of me purchasing it. The new inserted play mat for the original blow up moonsand kit makes it that more fun for him to play like he's at the Monster Trucks show!

Great Idea! for a new and fun way to make and keep moonsand play sets interesting.

Yes, moonsand can get messy, but didn't we all learn creatively through making messes when we were younger? I'll gladly sweep this up when he's done

I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my 83 year old aunt this past Christmas.  On Christmas Morning, as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank Kit.  It was an instant hit!  As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter.  Oddly enough, this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family Christmas gift-giving.  Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt.  What an awesome gift

Both of my kids got these for Christmas - great idea; not as expensive as a DVD player for the car (especially for those of us who don't want the portable one/plan to get next vehicle with built in) and the picture was really better than I thought it would be.

However, I only got my children two discs a piece to start.  Now, NO discs worthwhile can be found anywhere.  The only ones that are ever on the racks/online en masse are the Star Wars 3 pack (none of today's kids really want that), the Tony Hawk Skate Park (obviously they aren't interested there either) and Fear Factor (let's face it, if you let your kids watch FF you need to take the VideoNow player and hit yourself in the head - HARD).And even if I do find a couple on Ebay, the selection is so limited.  I wish I'd just bought a cheap portable DVD player.  Hasbro really missed the boat on this one - it could have been a great thing but they didn't make enough discs of the ones they do produce and need to put more shows out for the kids.  My advice: Don't buy it.  I am very disappointed in the disc selection - this is already at the bottom of the toy box.

Webkinz Pets are an excellent choice for a child who wants to use the internet and a parent who values internet safety. The pets are adorable and my children are addicted! Fun for parents too!

This umbrella can be used with lots of other playsets, not just the Little Tikes brand. We use ours staked in the ground next to our Step 2 Naturally Playful sandbox/wading pool and we take it along and use it with his folding plastic chair that has an umbrella hole and clip. Great for hot days at the pool, beach or just hanging around in the backyard. It comes with a storage/ carry bag that has a carrying strap for over-the-shoulder hauling around, too. It has a wind vent at the top, but I would still close it at night or take it indoors if you have high winds, since it is a petite size and weighs less than similar full-size versions sold to adults. Nice forest green color and white pole and finial; the fabric is heavy-weight and overall the umbrella seems well-made. A great buy at this price

My son is 11 and loved this.  He was very proud when he built it by himself.  It is very detailed and has movable parts so that you can also play with it (gently of course).  This is the type of piece that is great all by itself without getting all the other pieces in the series.  It is also a classic piece in that it doesn't have a cartoon or charter theme

Every time I see my twin daughters riding these bikes around I make a promise to write a review of the product. Here I am fulfilling my promise. They were able to pedal the bike within 2 - 3 days of getting them. They are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that I can carry both in the back of my small car (89 chevy camaro) and are light enough that I can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike. The only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns.

My daughter (15 months) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll, which was a gift from my best friend.  I've NEVER seen her react like this to any gift. My daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere--usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware. The doll has a soft, squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has, as my husband is constantly saying, "a hard plastic head."

My son needed this gun to go with his Halloween costume.  Needless to say he was thrilled with it.  It has held up under a lot of use, and the noise is not too loud and irritating.

My son (5 year old) chose this toy as his reward and was so excited when he received it. He and his brother and dad enjoy countless hours of pretend play as they are all Star Wars fans.  It has a realistic appearance and the sound is not irritating as are many toy guns. Highly recommended

The X-23 figure availible on Amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a variant that is alot harder to find [I resorted to eBay for mine].  The build of the figure is great - There's so much articulation, it's insane; and her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool.  The articulation, for the most part, is great.  My only qualm with it is it makes her arms look funny but I can deal with that.  She's barely 6 inches tall, I don't expect her to be perfect.  However, the reason I'm giving her three stars is because I feel the purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted X.  I recieved my black clad X-23 first and expected the same figure but in a purple for my other one but I was wrong.  The black X-23 has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the purple X-23's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her head almost impossible to move around.  Also, the thing that bothers me the most is that X's eyes are green on the black suited version but on the purple suited version, they're orange.  I am a big X-23 fan and I understand that when she's "triggered", her eyes go crazy reddish orange, but that's not something I really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor.  It's kind of creepy!  And on a sidenote, when did X-23 wear purple?  In her comics she was either in black, dressed as a civilain or in the old Wolverine costume [which you can see in the comic that comes with X-23].  I would've prefered a variant wearing the Wolverine costume while the black X-23 was mass produced.  So, personally, I would recommend hunting down the variant of X-23 for your collection.  She looks nicer and, I think, is more true to the character

I bought this toy for my daughter almost a year ago now. She still plays with it all the time. It is by far her fav toy. The only problem is that it's a bit too load and no way to turn it down, or off. Well, besides that it is a perfect toy for small kids. My daughter is almost 4 and still is not tired of it

The is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games I have ever played.  The first time we played was on Christmas Day.  We had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it.  We played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat.  It is also a great way to break the ice.  I would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner, this game can't be beat

Okay, we all know about the Disney CARS craze and trying to hunt down all the new die-cast characters Mattel puts out. These 1:24 scale models are very, very nice and the size is perfect for young boys, girls or collectors.  The only downside is that they only made Mater and McQueen. Who wouldn't love to see Chick Hicks or The King in 1:24 scale?! Come on Mattel! Get with it!!  ;
