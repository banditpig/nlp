The resort has all the facilities you would expect. It was our second trip to Sandals and it lived up to the great service we had first time.The only drawback is the lack of shade around the beach area.All shaded sunbeds were reserved (many by Butlers) by 6 am!.,POSITIVE,0.55,0.45

The resort was beautiful. The beach was amazing. The grounds were immaculate.We were in the Carrabian end of the resort which was the older part of the complex. (Room 509). The room was lovely but you could tell it was older. The bed was firm.As the resort is quite large it never really had the feel of being crowded which was nice. The main complaint would be that there was not enough shade. The few shades on the beach were 'reserved' very early by customers who had paid for butlers. Very often these shades would stay empty for much of the day. Around the pool the shades often had to be put down because it got too breezy.The choice of places to eat was great. A really good variety and all of very high quality.,POSITIVE,1.0,0.0

"My wife and I got married at the resort last year and decided to return for our anniversary. We opted for the same package as before - villa with private plunge pool and butler service. We were allocated a villa on the Caribbean side and as we walked out onto the patio, a cat was waiting to ""greet"" us!! My wife has a fear of cats and this cat wasn't for leaving! We then realised we were right beside the ""Cat CafÃ©""....a kennel-like structure with feeding bowls. The next day we were moved to a villa on the Mediterranean side which, in fact, was the villa we had the year before and which we much preferred as it was quieter. Our main concern was dining, particularly at Bayside and especially at Eleanor's where, at one point, we had 4 cats under our table (Eleanor's being labelled as the top restaurant in the resort)....completely unacceptable!! We therefore had to stop eating at the Caribbean side for fear of this happening again. There should be a strict ""no feeding the cats"" rule as not all guests are happy to dine with them!Our only other criticism was the activities beside the main pool....at certain points, it felt like we were on an 18-30's holiday with Bingo and games being played. Having paid $17,000+ for our 10 day holiday, it just didn't feel as classy as the previous year. 4 stars is still good but sadly not exceptional.",POSITIVE,1.0,0.0

"this is a lovely well kept resort which is in a lovely location with great gardens and facilities. If it wasn't for the lack of attention to detail we would have rated it higher but too many little things needed a bit more consistency. Towels and drinks were lacking at the smaller pool we preferred relaxing by and housekeeping was dependent on what time they got to the room and what toiletries or tea and coffee they had left to leave in the room. Food, drink and service were always very good at restaurants and bars.",POSITIVE,0.8,0.2

The facilities were good but most restaurants were not as good as previously. Eleanors was very good.though and the breakfast in Bayside. As Diamond guests we expected but were not given: In room check-in ( after 1 hour at reception tablet not working)we had to return next day. No goodies left in room. No flowers in room. WE DID GET a Tshirt each. This was our 4th visit to Antigua but overall we will not be inclined to go again.,POSITIVE,0.94,0.06

"Sandals can normally be relied upon to give a brilliant holiday experience. This site, like all the other 6 we have stayed at, provides wonderful rooms; a wide variety of restaurants; high quality food and drinks; wonderful and friendly service; beautiful gardens; and great entertainment.During the day we like to sunbath in quiet shady areas. We have found that this is the one area that Sandals, sometimes, falls short of the standard we come to expect. The Antigua resort is the poorest we have visited in this respect. There are more than enough sunbeds but many do not have shade or are located around noisy pools. You have to be up before 7am to reserve a sunbed with shade. Even then there were several mornings when we were literally the last to find a suitable bed. We expressed our concerns via the 'loop' but only got a bland reply - obviously Sandals are not concerned about this issue! If you don't mind getting up every day before 7am then I can't fault this resort but, if like us, you would prefer to get up later then avoid this resort. Many other Sandals' resorts are a lot better.This is a large site with beautiful gardens. The resort fronts onto a clean beach. All beaches in Antigua are open to the public. Consequently, there are many people wandering up and down the beach trying to sell you things. However, they are very friendly and will only engage with you if that is what you want. If you are sunbathing on or near the beach, the friendly staff will come and take you orders for drinks.There are a lot of restaurants serving a wide variety of food. There are ony 2 restaurants that require a reservation with about 3 days leadtime. There was only one restaurant, Barefoot on the Beach, where there was a problem getting a table. You needed to be there when it opened otherwise you would have to wait for a table. One of the restaurants. Eleanor's, provides a la carte breakfasts. This was our favourite and we had all our breakfasts here.Overall, a great holiday let down by having to get up before 7am.",NEGATIVE,0.27,0.73

The resort is great we had a fantastic week relaxed a lot which was ideal exactly what we were after. One slight thing that was a bit of a pain was if you didn't take the butler service you didn't manage to get beds on the beach with an umbrella for some shade as the butlers had been down and reserved the beds for the guests early in the morning. I think next time we will take the butler service purely for this as was nightmare especially as we had caught a bit too much sun the first day.,NEGATIVE,0.48,0.52
